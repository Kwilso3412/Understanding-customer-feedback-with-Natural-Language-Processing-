0,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,07/17/2024,I was delivered a car with broken air bags that took 2 weeks to fix. I extended the 7 day to the *** to give the car I picked a chance to access. Do to their lack of communication am not allowed to swap for a different one. I am looking for a lawyer to attack this 1.61 rated car seller. Please advise if we can take down this corrupt business.,no response,No response
1,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,07/17/2024,"Easy to buy from, and thats about it.Initial purchase was simple, simple process even with my own financing provided. Delivery was relatively smooth although it was delayed a few days (to be expected if you read their reviews)Problems started at the end of the delivery where there was a mileage discrepancy with the vehicle. They quickly made things right by reimbursing the mileage at a certain rate. But the major problem I have is that the car needs warranty work that they said they would address (cosmetic issues aren't usually covered unless noted within the return period). No problem right?Wrong, since they reported the wrong mileage to SilverRock (the warranty provider) the car exceeds the allowed warranty mileage and they said that this would be corrected. I've called multiple times and each time they noted to ""address the issue"" and it would be corrected int ***** business hours. Everytime I contacted silverrock they still shown the old mileage in their system and insisted I need to address with Carvana. Its been nearly 2 months I been battling this and still cannot use the warranty on the car and I've called every week since I've received the vehicle. I don't recommend, they make it easy to take your money. But thats about it.",no response,No response
2,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,07/16/2024,"Purchased my vehicle with a large down payment over a week ago, scheduled drop off time was between 8-11 AM on Monday, July 15th. I received a call at 8:36 am that morning telling me that they don't have a title or registration for the vehicle and don't have a date for me to receive the car. Later that day, they changed my appointment to Wednesday, July 17th between 11am-2pm. I called them today, July 16th to confirm that my car would be delivered and was told that ""everything looks like it's good to go on our end"". Shortly after that phone call I got a notification that my appointment has been moved to Tuesday, July 23rd. I called back again and was told that they don't have the title, they also said ""maybe ***** lost it in the mail or something"" which is a bogus runaround answer that lacks accountability on their end. They keep suggesting that I pick a different car but I want the car that I PURCHASED. I was left with a ""maybe"" answer as to if it will be here by the 23rd or not. If I could give 0 stars for this company, I would. When I told them I was concerned about purchasing through them due to their negative reviews online I was told to ""take negative reviews with a grain of salt"". Is the BBB not a credible source of information when looking into a company like this? They are at 1.61 stars for a reason and all of my concerns that I had before my purchase are coming at me full force. I will be telling all of my friends, family, and everyone I encounter to never use this scam of a company.",no response,No response

4,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,07/15/2024,"Just wanted to share my experience with a recent transaction with Carvana as a warning, especially if you plan to put money down on a car purchase.Last week I saw a truck I wanted on Carvana. The truck was supposed to be in stock locally and had a small delivery fee of $290. I started the process on a Wednesday and the listing said it could be delivered Sunday.During the purchase process I put $13,000 down on the truck. When I finished the process the delivery date changed to Monday.Sunday came and the delivery date was pushed out to Thursday. At this point I started wondering if they even had the vehicle. It was held by one of their partners.Later I was reviewing the financing when I noticed they didn't apply my down payment to the financing. They just financed the entire cost of the vehicle.This is when I lost all confidence in Carvana and called to cancel the deal. The rep said the deal was canceled and my down payment would be refunded. But, the next day I realized the transaction was not cancelled so I had to talk to another rep to get it done.Then the part that really hurts, I can expect my down payment back in 10 to 15 days. The money came out the minute I completed the forms. There is no indication of when the refund will be or has been issued. Now I have over $13,000 dollars tied up until they get around to returning it. I have scheduled 2 calls with Carvana and they haven't called me back.",no response,No response
5,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,07/15/2024,"Look at all these bad review!!! Buy at your own risk. I purchased a vehicle from them in October. They **** me in falsely with their ease of purchasing online. Misleading estimated monthly payments and ease of purchase and vehicle inspections. I applied for their house financing. I never saw anything about apr until after I purchased vehicle. My fault completely. My credit alone should not have been an apr that high. PREDATORY LOANS. The vehicle they sold me. At 112 days the airbag warming light comes on. Car shakes when I stop. Transmission is slipping. They advertised a 150 point inspection. Thats a lie. The front bumper is obviously been impacted. The car fax shows previous accident. I believe my state requires it to be reported prior to purchase. They failed to apply for registration and title until the temp plates expired costing me more money to get plates. I tried to refinance and because they failed to register the plates I lost my refinance process. All while gaining interest on my already high interest loan. Its now July and the vehicle gives me whiplash when it shifts from gears while driving. Im so frustrated with them. Im stuck with this garbage vehicle that I purchased from them. The vehicles original purchase was $16,900 already overpriced for a 6 year old vehicle. With their in house financing in the end. If I had not secured refinancing. I would have paid a total of $32,000 for a $16,000 vehicle that probably wont last the length of the loan. So Im convinced many people end up upside down in the loans with them.  Please if there is any lawyer willing to bring a class action lawsuit against them. Their loan practices are misleading and their vehicles are garbage.",no response,No response

We were happy to find a **** Focus with only ****** miles on it thinking it would last because my previous **** lasted to ******* miles.  **** than 3 weeks after purchase the car broke down on I4 and hasnt run correctly for more than a week since. We have spent more than $10,000 on repairs and on July 4th it was once again stranded our teenage son in the middle of a busy ******* intersection in the tourist district.  I guess this was better than the two times hes been broken down on I4 with cars flying by him.  We cant trade it because 1. It doesnt run and 2. Too much negative equity.  Negative equity we could have paid off had we not spent every ***** we have and maxed out credit cards to even keep it running.  Now its dead again and no one can figure out how to fix it.  Carvana says the car was fully inspected which is impossible considering it broke down less than 3 weeks after we bought it and has continued to break down since.  Its spent more time at the mechanic than it has on the road and our son is unable to work or commute to school.

They refuse to exchange the vehicle from their mess up even when I offered to exchange for an older and cheaper vehicle. A bunch of crooks!

I got started on the purchase of the vehicle, made the down payment, and got the screen saying purchase completed and the vehicle is on its way. Was informed they just needed to verify my paystubs. I was then emailed the next day, informing me I had documents missing and had until noon to upload the documents. Email was received barely an hour before the deadline. I called at my lunch time at noon, informed carvana that I had submitted all the documents needed as well as was shown the purchase completed. They reevaluated the terms and told me I would need a $4,000 down payment for the vehicle. This was after the initial down payment was received as well as the terms pre-approved.

So they delivered it defective and I have to PAY $100 deductible to have it looked at and/or fixed. I had a roadtrip planned the next day after this was delivered so I didnt get it looked at before my 7 day return window closed.

Their communication is poor, and they seem more interested in making excuses than in providing real solutions.I strongly advise against using Carvana for your car buying needs.

OK, but at 8pm on the 8th day, 13 hours before the scheduled weekday pickup, I received a text saying it would be another two days because of a shipping delay. I'd already taken off work, pulled the kids out of daycare and cleared out my old car for a trade in -- oh yeah, the trade value they offered was $2k less than KBB. I asked to have the $690 shipping cost at least partly refunded to compensate and they flat out refused because they were ""not contractually obligated"" to take care of me. I offered to drive to wherever the car was to get it and received an email saying that wouldn't work because it was a failed State inspection, not shipping, that caused the delay because of a busted tail light. That's odd because I received a detailed ""150 point Carvana inspection report"" that specifically said they'd checked the tail light and gave it the OK. How am I supposed to be confident in the inspection of everything else they claimed to have cleared, even when they missed something a child (much less a mechanic) could see was broken? I said I wanted to cancel my order and learned it could take 10 bus. days to get my money back (longer for the shipping cost, if at all). So, they took my money right away and held it, which prevented me from backing out of the deal after they lied about the inspection and failed to deliver on time (NINE DAYS after the ""purchase"").

Additionally, the vehicle stalled when trying to accelerate past 40mph on uphills and curves. I communicated this to Carvana. I then decided to swap the vehicle (Im within the 7-day return window). I was told to call an agent FIRST before starting the swap process. I did. Within hours Im being asked for additional income verification. I submitted it. I was asked for it again; I submitted it. I was then asked for it the next day (today) I did. Then Im notified that the car I chose to swap for was put back into stock because I exceeded the time to submit required documents. I immediately called Carvana. The following scenario took 2 HOURS out of my time:1st. Spoke with an agent who said I needed to submit 6 months worth of bank statements. I let them know that I could only provide 4 months worth because I did not have a bank account prior to March. They said that I still had submit 6 months-worth of bank statements. I asked for an escalation and said I wanted to speak to a supervisor. I could not understand why I was being asked for additional documents for financing if I had already been approved for the previous car. 2nd. Im transferred. The agent is empathetic and says that I shouldnt have been asked for more documents because this was just a swap not a new purchase. She transfers me to start the swap process 3rd. I am reiteres the same by this agent, and told Im sorry. We shouldnt have asked for more documents because youve already been approved for financing for the previous car and the new car that youre wanting to swap for is within the same tag price.

Unfortunately, within a month of purchase, significant mechanical issues arose, including problems with the left/right upper chain tensioners, upper timing covers, seals, and gaskets. Although these initial repairs were covered under warranty, they were a major inconvenience.More recently, on May 28, 2024, the vehicle developed cylinder misfires, leading to extensive diagnostics revealing the need for a complete engine replacement. The repair costs are staggering, exceeding $7,000, with ongoing expenses anticipated.Despite promptly contacting Carvana about these issues, I was informed that they could not assist further because the problems arose beyond their 7-day return window.I am deeply disappointed and frustrated by Carvanas failure to deliver a vehicle in the condition promised. The experience has caused significant financial strain and inconvenience.I advise extreme caution to anyone considering a purchase from Carvana based on their inspection claims.

I don't have the privilege of being able to go through the car buying process again, so I'm hopeful nothing else is wrong. I was very very rude to them, but after my roommate and mine's experiences, I just can't care as they clearly don't respect their customers. I am clearly very silly for going through them, I don't know why I thought it would be different. I just hope the windshield crack doesn't get bigger before I can replace it.

The final time they told me that the delay was due to a broken windshield that I was never made aware of. They assured me that it happened in transport and that they would do a full inspection. Finally, the car arrived two weeks late and, upon taking it off the tow truck, I realize that the front heat shield was only half attached to the bottom of the car and dragging on the ground. How is this missed if they did a full inspection? Since the car was not driveable, I had to reject the delivery and send it back to be repaired. It was re-delivered after the fix and a day later I realized that the front left headlight was broken. Now I need to take it to a repair shop and get a quote to send to Carvana.

Today as I was driving to drop my kids off to school my car stopped in mid traffic two cars almost collided trying to avoid hitting me. I am so great full that the lord was watching over me because my car could have been hit and I had my three small children with me the youngest being 7 months I was terrified and I no longer trust this vehicle. carvana is telling me that there is nothing that they can do for me other than a trade-in plus an additional $4000 as a down payment for a new vehicle due to the negative balance, I would have on my loan after the trad in. I dont know about anyone else, but as a single mother of three I dont have an additional $4000 to pull Out of my behind after just spending the same amount a year prior to get into this car, I just think that its unfair to the customer because clearly the car was no good from the very beginning. I am a pretty fair person. I dont care about any balance from my current loan being carried over I care about my safety and the safety of my children.

They make it so easy to finance with them. Just click the button. How hard is that? Your low monthly payments are fantastic and they didnt require a down payment. BUT, even with perfect credit like me, what you dont know because they dont tell you, is that they are charging you credit card interest rates. Im talking 22 to 23 percent. But the story gets worse.Merely financing with them affects your credit score in a very negative way. And when you discover their credit scam and you try to pay off the balance, they wont let you. They demand that you ask for a quote on your payoff amount. Now I dont know about anyone else, but this is some sleazy financial c*** going on.

I did the self-appraisal online, which I was honest and reported all issues my car was currently having (including white smoke from exhaust).  When they came out for the appointment to buy my car, my check engine light had started to sporadically turn on and off.  I told them this immediately upon arrival, and the field advocate told me ""he forgot his chip"" and couldn't run the computer to see what was wrong.  His manager told him to ""reject"" the car and not take it.  Little did I know ""rejecting"" the car would put it into a 3-5 day ""manual appraisal"" process.  I asked why this was necessary rather than me just adjusting the self-appraisal and getting a new offer instantly online.  It was because of his ""rejection"" due to him not having the correct tools that should be standard on his vehicle.  Once the new offer was received, they took $2400 off the initial offer, stating the reason being the check engine light AND the smoke (which was already disclosed on the initial offer!!).  Mind you they never even ran a diagnostic to see what that light was on for and shaved that much money!  They then tried to charge me DOUBLE for the pickup fee for the car!  Instead of it being a $190 pickup fee, they were then trying to charge $490 to pickup the car!  No explanation, just told me there was nothing they could do.  Ironically, the fee went back down to $190 with no explanation and minutes later. The ONE positive experience was the one I had with the last field advocate.  He was very nice and said he would absolutely take the car after running all tests.  Said it all depends who you get, and they have ""discrestion"".  I will NEVER work with CARVANA again.

The Prius Prime does not distinguish which tire was sending the signal.The limited warranty company Carvana contracts with and reported the issue.

I eventually contacted my bank for any info they had with carvana and they were told the same thing AFTER they already cut a check to them and did the whole pre-approval documents/purchase agreements. Last thing, in the cycle of the 100 rerouted phone calls/transfers,,, one of the ladies (**************) whatever tf it was, hung up on me because she couldnt answer my question regarding the verification email I received(emails aid I missed the deadline and the vehicle would be sent back to inventory. I already uploaded everything to the dashboard including the check) She just kept repeating on my end I can see you received an email to complete x,y,z which has zero to do with my question or even the slightest idea on how to proceed. Lost in the ***** majorly.  Just go to your local dealer.",no response,No response

Now I had some issues about 15 days into it and they fixed those. And I understand that my warranty ran out on May 4th. I took it back this past Monday because one of the items that they were fixing The part finally came in. There was also a noise that they supposedly had a dress when I dropped it off initially 14 or 15 days after the purchase. They shot showed me in pictures what was wrong and stated that 1 of the items was an inspectable item and that the car should not have passed inspection. Carvana expected it in January when I bought it.  My whole gripe is that he showed me pictures and there was rust on the bushings and the coil springs which all needed replacing. That is not something that I did in the 4 months and 5000 miles that I have driven The car. And if the motor for the sunroof had been in sooner I would have dropped it off then and they would have found it before the expiration date of my warranty. You cannot get anybody on the phone now that you have purchased the car. If I had bought the car at a wholesale price or something like that I would understand. But us as consumers are paying carvana retail and over retail. At the price I paid,  I  Would expect that at least the inspectable items would have been Corrected.  Anyways I know this will not hurt their company but if I were a consumer I would not buy anything from these people.

There was even puke in the back seat which I did not see right away because they put the tiny floor mat over it. With in days I noticed the car would move out of park without pushing on the brake or the shifter would be completely stuck and not shift out of park. The line that connected it was broken. The check engine light was on. I took it in to get fixed. The repair facility took multiple days to complete the work and when I got my car back the center console would no longer stay closed. They put it back together incorrectly. They also did not address the check engine light after I paid the $100 deductible for the silver rock warranty. They cleared the code and said if it came back on to come back. Well it came back on. I ended up finding a different repair facility because of the spotty work they did. The purge valve was faulty and silver rock wouldn't cover it because the manufacture warranty covered it. I had to take it to a dealer to have it fixed. The dealer found a leaking power steering line. Back to a silver rock repair facility to have that repaired under the warranty. All with in the first 90 days I have had my car in the shop four times.

First off, when purchasing a vehicle, I had searched for a manual transmission and selected a car labeled with a manual transmission. Upon delivery, the car is an automatic, and I was informed that the car I reviewed in the listing is the literal car, any discrepancy between the listing and the photo is your own fault for not noticing. Not a huge deal, but I dont like being lied to. Two years later, after purchasing CarvanaCare Plus (with terms amounting to coverage for 3 years/******* miles) I am now informed that the repairs required to get the car running again are not covered because the car is over the ******* mile limit set by the warranty. Now, I purchased the vehicle with ****** miles, but nowhere is the distinction made that the coverage is 3 years past POS and ******* miles TOTAL on the car, not additional miles. This is frustrating on its own. The worse part is that I had communicated directly with a real person before the repairs, to make sure I was covered. The website said I had 12 months left, which felt suspicious. The real person asked for the current mileage, which is ******* miles, and told me that I do in fact still have 12 months or ****** miles left. After taking the car in, the warranty was denied be the outside service, claiming that I am over the mileage limit. So they lied directly to my face.

I inquired about the delivery/shipping fee? I asked where the vehicle was and was told it was at their Hendersonville hub location.  I then asked if I picked up the vehicle there would I have to pay that fee and was told no, there is no delivery/shipping fee if it's picked up in person. Then when I started the checkout process, there was that fee, $690, that I was assured I wouldn't have to pay. I was paying $33900.00 plus $1650 insurance for drive train warranty. I asked the chat bot for help and was a complete waste of time. I asked ********* if I could speak to a real person. Started texting with ********,  and either she was a chatbot or was reading off a script, saying ""unfortunately we don't negotiate prices"". I'm not trying to negotiate,  I'm trying to pay full price in cash, less the delivery fee. She went on to say I was confused and didn't understand? I asked what is so confusing when I'm told if I pick up the truck in person, the fee would not be charged.  Finally,  after feeling like I was still talking to a chatbot, asked to call someone,  and was given their number. Was on hold for 10 minutes.  ****** answered and I explained what I was told and what was happening.  And as if reading off a script ""we don't negotiate prices"", and went on to say that they had to load it on a truck and deliver it to my ho.e address.  I reiterated,  again, that I would be picking it up where it was currently at. And again he stated that it would have to be loaded up and brought to my house. I said, when I inquired about picking it up, was told that fee would NOT BE CHARGED. Being told that, then still insisting that I have to pay that and that they don't negotiate,  is very deceptive, and dishonest and they try to make you feel stupid for questioning their deceptive practices.

My first experience with them was fine. The last two were not so good. As the company has scaled, their customer experience has dropped significantly and their processes and policies have become less customer friendly. On my latest purchase, I have spend hours speaking  and texting with customer service reps. ***** reps are well intentioned, but they are not set up for success because of the way Carvana does business. They don't have an answer for you and there is literally no way to escalate any issues you may have. I requested to speak with a higher level employee about my issue, from three different reps, and the answer each time was ""there is no way to do that."" That is an awful experience to have and that puts the reps in an impossible position. The issue: I bought/picked up the car on Friday, on Saturday morning I noticed oil leaking and wheel misalignment. I put in a request with their warranty provider, SilverRock, to fix the issues. ********** denied the requests. I then went back to Carvana and they said there is nothing they can do. In this case, the 150 point inspection they do on cars before selling them failed, and they sold the car with issues and did not take responsibility for that. Because their warranty provider won't cover it, I am 'out of luck'. I need to pay for repairs myself. The facts here are that Carvana sold a car that did not meet their standards, they don't have a way to take responsibility for that because of their internal processes and policies, and their customer service reps don't have a way to help you escalate your issues. This leaves the customer in a one-sided situation with no way to escalate or fight Carvana's decisions.",no response,No response

When I bought my first vehicle at Carvana (2015 ****** Corolla), the agent of representatives ************************* would ask for documents (proof of insurance, ID etc...) and everytime I'd send to them, I would receive either a text or email from them saying they haven't received anything and if I didn't send them by the deadline (next day at 11am), I would lose the vehicle to another buyer. I would email them and then call them. They'd tell me they haven't received anything. I'd proceed by sending them everything they asked while I was on the phone with them until they confirmed they received everything. That was a bad experience, but I thought it was an isolated incident. The second vehicle I bought from them, was a ******** I found on their website and really liked. I also had one of vehicle that I wanted to trade it (a lease) so I end up with two vehicles (****** Corolla and ******** ****** Everything seemed okay at first.

First, the car had no fuel in it on delivery, with the ***** Carvana citing they were not allowed to put premium gas in cars. So we had to fill it up ourselves as it was empty.Second, on the way home the air conditioning stopped working.Third, upon arrival at home the check battery light came on and gps wouldnt program and the trunk would not open. I contacted Carvana and was told the only option was to return the car or have it repaired under warranty. Really under warranty? For a car I just bought? They did say they were sending a $60 check for fuel(which I received today). We then took it, at their recommendation, to ********* who had no clue how to test the battery in a Range Rover. They said the battery was good yet the light remained on. I called Carvana again saying I wanted my car back as the stress of this vehicle was wearing on me. Carvana told me I could not have my car back and the only option was to fix this one on warranty or bring it back to exchange. Again, I needed to go thru warranty for a vehicle I just bought?? With fear of having the battery go dead we took it to the Land Rover dealer in ******** and they replaced the battery. Lo and behold with a new battery there is no longer a low battery warning light and the system was checked. The gps and trunk now work as well. I then removed and replaced the cabin ac filter and guess what? The ac also works now. I checked the engine air filter and discovered it was full of leaves and dirt. I replaced it.

We contacted Carvana to see what they were willing to do and they assured us because we had coverage through Silverrock they would make it right, we just had to follow Silver Rocks process, inconvenient but we followed the process. We took it to one of their shops, we had to wait to get it into the shop for their next opening. Theshop couldnt complete the work, so we had to move it to another one of their preferred shops, we requested they extend the money back guarantee due to this so they gave us a couple extra days..anyways, Silver Rock took their time to have an adjuster review the documents, so it sat at the shop multiple days just waiting. Again, we accepted the inconvenience but then the shop magically couldnt do the work..so again, we were told to move the vehicle, I requested to take it to **** again and Silver Rock agreed. I called Carvana to ask for an additional extension on the money back, just until I could hear from **** and Silver Rock to ensure they would cover the work, the manager I spoke with was very rude to me even though I tried to be nice and explain the series of unfortunate events we had encountered up to this point. We were trying so hard to keep the truck as it was exactly what we were looking for. The manager was very rude and essentially told us there was no way it could be extended. I called Carvana later asking them to pick it up and magically they were able to ***** us a few extra days to hear back from ****. We received a final diagnostic from ****, which showed all of the issues previously AND additional issues. over $10k and looks like it has been in a wreck.Carvana picked the truck up due to the amount of issues, they picked it up late on Thursday. We made the issues known and showed documentation ). 2 days later and they reposted it for sale, their inspection shows it passed, but, I can with 100% certainty say that was not the case",no response,No response

285,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,03/10/2024,"Liars! I bought a ""Carvana Certified"" car from them, which comes with their 150 point inspection guarantee. The inspection clearly states that all tires meet requirements, which is at least 4/32 tread depth. In my state, all vehicles must pass state inspection within 10 days of purchase, so I immediately brought my car down to an inspection location to have that done. Well, what do you know, the front two tires don't pass inspections, and they read 2/32 tread depth. You have to fix anything that doesn't meet standards to pass inspection, so I had the mechanic go ahead and replace the two front tires for a cost just shy of $300. I contact Carvana customer service because they should reimburse me for these tires. It took a lot of back and forth, but I was eventually told I would be reimbursed. The kicker is that the whole process would end up taking many weeks, and I would receive a check in the mail (who does that any more?). All those weeks pass, and I do not receive my check. I contact customer service again, and they tell me my claim was ""denied"" by their finance department. I then went round and round with that customer service agent, and they told me they submitted my claim again. Here we are, weeks later, and still no check. It's important to note that I have all the paperwork/proof to back this up, and I submitted that to Carvana, so this is not a case of hearsay. It's also important to note that this whole process has been shady: you can't save customer service chats (you have to screenshot instead), they say there is no case number to give you to reference your claim, and if you are denied by their finance department there is no notification at all - you just have to wait the full 10 weeks or whatever and contact customer service again for a status update. All I want is what is fair - Carvana lied on the inspection report, and I need to be reimbursed for those tires ASAP.",no response,No response

My initial experience was positive, which is why I returned.

This response was disappointing, especially since the damage was not disclosed prior to purchase.While I understand that used vehicles come with some wear and tear, transparency about the vehicle's condition is crucial for an informed purchase decision.

I bought a car from Carvana, financed by ***********, in 2021. Since then, I've had ongoing issues with getting the title, which Carvana says Bridgecrest controls. This has led to four lost private offers since 2021 and limited my selling options to Carvana or a dealership for a loss.  Initially (twice), *********** promised the title but later claimed I live in a ""no-title state,"" contradicting their earlier ability to provide it. Now, I can't get the title without paying off the debt, and refinancing is impossible due to lenders' distrust of Carvana/Bridgecrest. However, while on the phone with a Bank VP, they agreed to make a copy of the Title finally showing Carvana as the title owner. I.e., it was Carvana's business policy (not a ********) to prevent my private transaction by not allowing the title to be issued to the person paying the loan. Carvana's buyback offers also seem tied to my debt amount, contrary to their claims. Only twice did their offers not leave me owing money: once in 2021 when an offer expired because Bridgecrest didn't provide the title, and again today when adjusting the payoff amount on their site led to a lower offer. This shows Carvana adjusts offers based on debt/equity, against their fair trade claims. Also, If I had the title I would have sold the car for a profit in 2021 or 2022 (lost 4 offers trying to explain the paperwork). This situation highlights Carvana and Bridgecrest' s problematic relationship and their disregard for the financial impact on customers.

317,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,02/24/2024,Worst car buying experience!! Im an hourly plus commission employee. They said they couldnt use my commission bc it wasnt paid hourly.

Sent her an email stating her frost account didnt have the funds! But there wasnt an email from her actual bank account stating the funds were attempting to be deducted! And then changed the down payment to an extra 3 grand! However after reading the reviews! We decided not to buy and took our money elsewhere! Needless to say were happier with our purchase!

320,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,02/23/2024,"My recent purchase experience with Carvana has been disappointing, marked by false advertisements, misrepresentations, and a lack of resolution to significant concerns.Upon receiving the initial vehicle, I encountered multiple undisclosed issues, including more than six imperfections not mentioned during the purchase process. I was told to deal with it being a used vehicle but the rigged windshield with yellow glue all over alone would have cost thousands to fix out of pocket. Seeking resolution, I attempted to address these concerns with Carvana, but regrettably, my efforts were ignored.After discussions with their team, they agreed to swap the vehicle for another. The second vehicle presented an improvement, but my dissatisfaction resurfaced when I discovered that the promised features were missing. Despite receiving confirmation from Carvana's advocates that these features should be included before finalizing my swap, further escalation revealed that the company had tampered with the site data and removed these features from my vehicle details and specifications. Astonishingly, I continued to be charged the initial higher price as if these features were part of the deal which was about $1300 package outright from the dealership I don't have.Adding to my dismay is Carvana's lack of responsiveness and accountability. Despite multiple attempts to seek resolution, my concerns have been ignored for the second time. This disregard for customer satisfaction is disheartening.To compound matters, I recently discovered that Carvana has tampered with and deleted evidence from their site after my second complaint. This discovery further erodes any trust I had in their commitment to transparently resolving issues.As a customer who believed in the integrity of ********************, I am now left feeling misled, dissatisfied, and frustrated.

I started having major issues where the vehicle just conked out/stopped while driving.  At least 3 of the times I was on the highway. Thankfully we were in the right lane so we avoided being hit by oncoming vehicles. Because of this I paid the vehicle off sooner so that we could trade it in or sell it. I waited for almost 8 months thinking the title got lost in the mail. I finally called Bridgecrest after speaking to the ********** of ***** Vehicles in ***** where the car was titled. They told me that ********** was still showing a lien and therefore would not be able to release the title without their company writing to their offices releasing that the car loan was paid. As a result I called Bridgcrest/Carvana several times and spoke to several people. All of the people I spoke with were not going to do this to put it bluntly. They claimed that because I used a **** of America transfer balance account that it would need to be done by **** of ********* spoke with **** of America who said they had no loan or interest in the vehicle but were willing to send a notarized letter stating that to **********. I started this conversation at least 5 hours and was given the same bluntly said response from **********/Carvana that they could not release the lien standing firm that **** of America had to do this. I asked for a supervisor and they never would transfer me.As I mentioned earlier their company had their name on the ***** Title not **** of America.

When I got into the car and turned it on the smell of cigarettes was so bad I became nauseous. Then there was no 4WD like was also stated. As soon as I got home I called and began the swap process.  There were now no cars that fit my needs unless I paid a non-refundable shipping fee. Which after what happened I was not going to do. Then it took all the next day getting a swap figured out which now I had to pay a $290 down payment. The assured me the $90 I had already paid would be subtracted so only $200. This am they pulled $290 from my account and all they could say was sorry and they would refund once it cleared. My swap is still pending and I also had to add this vehicle toy insurance.

However, the moment I hit speeds above 40 mph, the vehicle began shaking violently, with violent steering feedback. I took it to ******************** a repair shop recommended by Carvana, only to discover that the axle was bent and needed replacement. Deciding to give Carvana the benefit of the doubt, I attempted to trade it in for another vehicle. But instead of rectifying the situation, the advocate informed me that I shouldn't have even been allowed to pick up the first car. Frustrated and fed up, I requested a pickup to return the vehicle. Did Carvana respond? No. Not on Friday, not on Saturday, not on Sunday, not even on Monday. When I finally managed to reach a representative, I was told my vehicle file had been ""accidentally deleted,"" and now I have to wait another 2-5 business days just to begin the return process. This has been by far the worst customer experience of my life. I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. Carvana's negligence and disregard for customer safety are appalling. And to top it off, they have the audacity to lie about their so-called ""150 point inspection."" I guess it was presumptive of me to assume that the 150-point inspection included the steering, alignment, or mechanical components of the vehicle. I refuse to let others fall victim to Carvana's deceit and endangerment. I will be sharing my story on every platform possible to protect fellow consumers. Avoid Carvana like the plague unless you enjoy being lied to, endangered, and treated like garbage.

Then not even one year later the transmission started to go out. I barley got it home from work. Then when I took it in I found out it also had bad cv's and bad suspension. Literally thousands of dollars to fix everything.  So I decided to get rid of the car and sell it back to them. To do this since I had negative equity on the car I had to pay ***** bucks to sell it back to them. Now remember I said the transmission was going out.

Convenience? Then, when they arrived with my new car, they decided they would not honor the trade in, telling me they then could not leave the new car as I'd have to re-negotiate the trade terms. This started an frustrating process of calls/promises of responses/passing off to various agents before my new car is no longer available to purchase so I have to find a replacement or wait weeks for my payment back,  and at a new  trade-in quote. This took more than 15 hours of calls to sort out over 3 days. Convenient? Not.Eventually, with terms agreed and another car coming, they then go into extra complication over payment. By now they have close to $20k of my money from the original deal to put toward this car but before agreeing delivery they need ""confirmation"" that I have the remaining $3k balance on this new price .....and to do this they provide an app which won't work with my bank so I have to get on the phone  a 3 way call with my bank and them to confirm yes, I have those funds....really?  That took 74 mins as the bank had us on wait until an agent was free. I could have just transferred to funds to them in a heartbeat but no, they 'had' to do it this way.  Convenient? Hardly.

After signing the papers they bring the vehicle to me to inspect.  ****** walked away I began inspecting.  It started out ok, oil was clean, tires good,engine didn't have corrosion etc.  Then I get to the drivers side and saw scratches down the rear drivers side door.  Then I see white paint substance on the drivers side wheel well in back and a broken plastic trim that was now unattached to the door.  I went in and told her that there were significant marks/defects on car and she came out and took photos.  I asked now what, she said that she would send photos and ""they"" (not sure who they are) would determine if they would make repairs.  No thank you.  When I purchase a vehicle I am not purchasing one I will already need to repair.  I said no thank you I want my trade in vehicle back.  She became obstinate,rude, etc.in front of my MINOR child who had accompanied me.  She wouldn't give my keys back, didn't let me know what was going on.  I was actually on the phone with CARVANA customer line and he heard some of what she said and he was so apologetic saying this is not at all the experience nor customer service that is expected.  I told her he said I was suppose to be shown the vehicle first per company policy and she said, ""Well Im the one that's here and this is how we do it"". Had she been compassionate and said let me see what we can do or even just showed some type of compassion for me after driving an hour to go pick up a car (that online did NOT have these issues) I feel it would have gone a lot better.

They hid this one under a Carvana sticker and I didn't notice it until the lady had gone and I took the sticker off a few days later! I thought that was shady.

Local delivery agent called on Jan 3, **** (delivery day) telling me that the car has no muffler (#** on their 150 point so-called inspection list). Funds cleared for the car on Jan 3. I'm still waiting for $20,430 to come back to my account and was told 3-5 business days from today by ****, a customer service agent. They say that funds will be returned within 3-5 days from the day that funds cleared.In addition their web pricing is not accurate and misleading. Cars that indicate a shipping fee of zero or $190 when the website has already acknowledged a delivery zip code, through the purchase process, ""magically"" now have a $590 or $990 shipping fee. I was able to reproduce this  phenomena multiple times, have screenshots, and showed the issue real time to a customer service agent.Great companies like Apple, Canon, Ikea, CVS stand by their service and have clear policies they live by. When they mess up, they do the right thing. If I could rate Carvana 0 stars I would. The web is littered with examples of everything I've described.

They refused to send mopar updated owner information so after 2 hours on the phone to figure it out mopar decided even tho it was carvanas responsibility they would switch the owner info.

I didnt have a car for a few days until Carvana could swap it for another car. They swapped it for a Malibu-I thought Carvana was known for doing quality checks and selling reliable cars but I was completely wrong. Soon the Malibu started making a loud noise. I took it to a shop and the wheel bearings, brakes, rotors, and other pieces needed to be replaced. A week after it started making another noise- back to the shop. It stayed at the shop for a few days. While at the shop the entire axel needed to be replaced. Mind you this car has not passed inspection. It has failed 6 times- each time going back and forth to the shop to get something new fixed.Next the check engine light came on- failed inspection- back to shop for a coolant issue/leak in the coolant hose.  Out of a car again for another day. Next the engine temperature gauge stopped working- back to the shop. Failed inspection again- Took the car to a different shop- during a smoke test they determined the entire underbody needed to be replaced. **************** wanted their own inspector out- which delayed the process- once again leaving me out of a car and ubering to work. Inspector approved the work and the entire underbody was replaced and extensive work completed- car still failed inspection. Now the inspection station is saying that it may be a software issue. I have ONLY HAD THIS CAR FOR ABOUT 4 months - and have barely been able to drive it, have spent so much money in Uber, lost work time, spent tons of money on gas for the inspection station- and wasted a lot of my time.

So I told USAA about it. They recommended Carvana, especially as a veteran. I went thru all the motions and paid for my car to be shipped. They were a day late already to deliver and when I got it, I had to take it to the mechanic they chose to get the transmission fixed. They failed to catch it in their 150 point inspection, I had to buy wiper blades. They blamed **** because the check engine light didn't show. The car had ****** or so miles.  ********** had their assessor ok sending them ""a"" transmission. A used transmission that had ****** miles less than the car i got had in the oddometer.

I had to pay for my $480 rental(mind you i started 2 days later than i dropped car off) and send them the paperwork to reimburse. $320 is what they gave back.

I called my bank and they told me Carvana would contact me but they never did. On 12/29/23 I received a later stating that I needed to pay back the $2010 or they would take legal action against me. Everyone was rude and refused to figure out the situation and no one knew how to operate their systems. This is a company that is not fulfilling their end of the service and they need to be held accountable for how they treat their customers.,no response,No response

So far my car isnt malfunctioning mechanically, however I did notice damage to my front bumper since it keeps detaching itself from both sides and now the front grill and lights are also coming out of the bumper. The Carfax didnt show any accidents whatsoever. My Attorney said they have a  rapport of buying cars not fully inspecting them  And then selling them with issues that  *** have been covered up by a local mom and pop fix it stitch it shop which seems to be in my case. I didnt want to leave them a negative review I felt it could be a ***** thing up until I realize there was spray paint, covering other areas of the car.  To me this sounds like his car was in a pretty bad fender ****** and I just hope for 2022 vehicle that it last longer than these cheap warranties that seem to expire within months if not weeks. Their partners ********** turn down my request saying that they dont cover cosmetic damages.

I had a most horrible experience with Carvana today because they messaged me after my appointment on Christmas eve to tell me that my car is not coming today but instead 4 days late.I'm incredibly disappointed in their ********* AI customer service and this overall business model that is designed to be policy heavy with a lot of contracts to protect themselves and leave customers out to hang dry when things go wrong.Obviously super regret having gone thru this process which ended up costing me wayyy more as my brother was able to purchase the same vehicle locally for 25% the cost I ended up paying for mine out the door. I paid $19,659 and he paid $14,800.In short, it looks like I'm the dummy for going with Carvana so I hope that anyone out there that are conscientious shoppers do not purchase from them like I had.  It looks enticing and easy to get it delivered but be patient and get one locally as the expectations there is a lot more manageable.  Further, even their car vending experience was a bit of a joke where they load the car right before you arrive and give you a big coin that you put in to dispense.  The lame thing is that the release of the car is not activated by the coin but instead an employee behind the table pressing the button to have the car unload.  Sadly, they some times even load the car after you get there as I saw with other customers.  It's like we're dummies and still believe in Santa.  All this said, this business is something else and turns out to be a dud of an experience but I'm sure others will have a much better experience if nothing goes wrong.  One tip for Carvana: Include in the business model to make customer service a thing by learning how to be accountable for your mistakes.  If you penalize customers for their mistakes, then please be balanced and be accountable to compensate customers for your mistakes rather than just...

Despite numerous attempts to address these issues directly with Carvana, I have faced significant challenges and inadequate responses, leading to this complaint.Initial Purchase and Inspection Discrepancy: The vehicle was purchased on 05/26/2022. An inspection dated 12/02/2021 (175 days earlier!) indicated that the air conditioning system 'Passed'. However, the ** was non-functional at the time of the test drive and required extensive efforts on my part for approval and repair under the 100-day warranty.Significant ******************Purchase: Currently, the vehicle requires extensive repairs, including the transmission, condenser, and radiator, totaling approximately $15,095. This is unfeasible given the vehicle's current payoff quote from Bridgecrest is $33,442.37 and the Carvana trade-in value is only $21,098.Insurance Claim Rejection: My insurance company, Geico, has declined to cover these repairs, leaving me to bear the full cost.Insufficient Support and Resolution from Carvana: Despite several communications with Carvana's support team the resolution offered was nothing. Concerns Over Initial Inspection Validity: There are concerns regarding the thoroughness and accuracy of the initial vehicle inspection, especially considering the immediate issues with the air conditioning and the substantial repairs needed shortly after purchase.Resolution Sought:I seek a fair and just resolution from Carvana, which includes either a comprehensive repair of the vehicle at no cost to me, a buyback of the vehicle at a reasonable price that acknowledges the issues and costs I have incurred, or a suitable compensation that addresses the financial discrepancy and inconvenience caused by this transaction.*************************",no response,No response

Just before the scheduled delivery we got notice that there was a delay and that the vehicle wouldn't arrive until the following week. The reason given for the delay was that there was a ""delivery issue"" with the vehicle, when I called to get more specific information the customer service agent was oddly cagey, that should have been my first clue. When the vehicle did arrive the driver was amazing and transparent. He mentioned a repair that was done after the vehicle was off loaded and that the damage and repair were the reasons for the delay. Basically, they lied.We had the vehicle for less than a day when there was a transmission issue. I called SliverRock and they tried to get me to take the vehicle to one of their ""authorized"" repair shops, all of which I  knew were garbage. I insisted on a local dealership specializing on our vehicle make and they reluctantly agreed.  The diagnostics revealed major body and mechanical issues not reported. The mechanic said that the *** was black, and it would likely need major transmission work and the passenger side was being held together by a ""ton of Bondo.""We immediately called and requested a swap. The only comparable car was $2000 more and they were absolutely unwilling to budge on the price nor were they willing to do anything for us. There was an additional mix up on the next delivery date and when the driver arrived he was an hour late. This vehicle needed 4 brakes/rotors, new air filters and two tires.",no response,No response

They invited me to swap my ride for one that has all the features. I found that one and let them know and even discussed it with them. They told me to create a new order and that once it was created and completed on the back burner they will get certain that the system take it as a swap and the cash money that I paid for the vehicle that i was returning be applied to the new order. It wasnt. So they went into my account and charged me almost 13k on top of the almost 11 that I had paid. Now they had 24k of my money plus 37k of my trade in.

Promises of contact from representatives were unfulfilled. I was told someone would reach out within half an hour, but no one did. My numerous texts and requests for assistance were ignored. This lack of response left me in a difficult position, especially considering the urgency of my need for a vehicle in a new state.The culmination of this frustrating journey was an email informing me that I had lost the opportunity to purchase the car. This was followed by a suggestion to call a phone number, which only added to my disappointment, as the call provided no resolution.Overall, my experience with Carvana was fraught with miscommunications, unmet expectations, and a lack of customer support. It was the worst car buying experience I have ever had, leaving me without a car and with wasted time and effort. For anyone considering using Carvana, I would recommend looking elsewhere for a more reliable and customer-focused car buying experienc3",no response,No response

First, if you need to talk to a real person expect to be disappointed. You have to fight through the system to get to an actual human being. You first have to go through a chatbot (a robot who attempts to answer your questions). Carvana does its best to require you to dedicate your whole day to the purchase process. So be ready. Sure, its important to provide proof of income, insurance, identity, etc. But to require multiple address verification documents is a bit much. And thats just for the A-list of documents. The they spring the **list of documents on you. This demand is exacerbated by the fact that you are only given a set amount of time to provide these documents. If you go over the deadline you have to begin again. After signing all the financial documents, Carvana and I finally agreed on a delivery date and time. On the morning of the delivery, I was contacted by email that I needed me to provide yet another address verification document. I complained, but I was told that this is what their system required. I reluctantly agreed to send another document. Thirty minutes before the delivery time, I received an email requiring another address verification document. I was at my office, and there was no way to download the required document from my location. I called Carvana and complained.  I had to leave my office and go home to retrieve the physical document, upload it to my computer, and then post it to my Carvana file. As it turns out, I ended up being 3 minutes late in getting the document to them. So my time was expired, and the whole process had to begin.When I was finally able to talk to a real person I told them that if there was no supervisor available to override the system I would happily terminate my purchase order and never look back. I was told that the system could not be changed.",no response,No response

The purchase price was set and I checked out with it and paid. The money was transferred and they set up delivery. Great--no problems there. Then on the day of delivery they moved the delivery to a different date, a Saturday, when I was going to be out of town. So I went online to change the date of delivery. At that time it asked me to edit the order. I got online and chatted with a customer support person named ******. He told me that was the only way to change the delivery date. At that time I realized that the delivery address they had was also wrong even though I had put in the correct address on my order. Again, this shouldn't be a big deal. The address was in the same zip code and actually closer (mileage wise) to the Carvana hub. However, when I went to press confirm on the detail changes, it asked me to ""Confirm Payment"". Since I had already paid, I thought this was odd, so I again talked with ****** who told me ""Please proceed, and we'll move the balance to the order and avoid new charges."" So I did as he said. Then when we received the truck there was an additional ACH payment of $426 that they added. I called customer support and they said that they would request the ********************* to take this charge off. The next day they sent me a text and said the request was denied. I tried to appeal, but there was no method that I am aware of for this. I was only left with the option to ship back the car since I was within my 7 day guarantee period and forfeit my $990 shipping charge, or keep the car and pay an additional $426. I chose to keep the truck since we needed it for our business, but I am very unhappy with Carvana and feel as though they are a dishonest car company and should return the $426 to our account.

Carvana made one huge mistake after another and broke promise after promise, resulting in them delaying delivering my car so many times I have lost count and me being trapped paying for a rental car for weeks. First, Carvana delayed my delivery date because they lost the cashiers check that my bank overnighted them, even though a Carvana employee signed for the check they received. (Carvana charges double the interest rates as local credit unions do, so of course I got the car loan from my bank.) Then on my new delivery date, Carvana called me an hour AFTER my delivery appointment to tell me that they LOST the key to the car and that it would be delivered the next day. Then at the third delivery date I received the first of the dreaded emails telling me Unfortunately, your order has been delayed due to a transportation delay and will now be delivered 5 days from now. Then at the fourth delivery date (a week later), I woke up to another email stating there would be another five-day delay with no further explanation. Every time I tried to call the Carvana customer care call center (which took hours out of my life day after day) I spoke with a different person at a corporate location (not on site) who had no idea what was really happening with my order and could only read me from the notes from my file: Theres a transportation delay and the car will be delivered to you on this new date. The call center never acknowledged that it wasnt even a transportation delay, but rather they were still waiting for a key to be made.

They don't negotiate, they require paperwork that they give you less than 24 hours to obtain that has to be notarized. I experienced delays up to 2 weeks with reasons I'm pretty sure they lied about. First it was a ""noticed something of concern"" situation. When I asked I got no explanation. No one knows anything in that company. Than it became an issue of transportation instead... Again they had no idea where the car was. I ended up finding it in ************. Initial pickup was for Oct 27th and I was in ************ that weekend for business and they knew I was going to be. Initially I had it scheduled for 5:30pm as I work full-time and have two kids that go to school so they rescheduled me for 8 am in the morning knowing I'm 1 hour and 46 minutes from the pick up location. They want limited power of attorney to register your vehicle... I can register my own vehicle FFS. And all the contracts you have to sign repeatedly is ridiculous...

Control arms are shot and the tire sensor was the cause of the abs light. We were told everything would be covered by the warranty because it was within the first 7 days. When the vehicle was done we were then told they did not cover the brakes or the filter. All things that should have been replaced when they did their so called fraud 150 inspection.

It made awful grinding noises, and after putting it back into Drive, it took a good couple minutes for the transmission to get it together. I let Carvana know, they said just take it to a shop to have it diagnosed. The shop said the transmission was out and that I shouldn't be pregnant and risking driving it. I called Carvana to ask them to come pick it up and that I would like to swap the vehicle. First they said I would pay for the tow bill if it was over $125. I said nope, not paying a dime for YOUR mistake. They sent a tow. Swapped for a GMC Acadia. The lady was nice and said they'd refund my $590 shipping charge for the inconveniences I had experienced, some not listed here, and would apply it to the Acadia. Picked it up on 10/31. Originally scheduled for 4PM but everyone wanted to leave early. I was called 1.5hrs before my appt to ask if I could be there in 30 minutes when I live an hour away. Got there by 3:30. The oil life was at 13% and all 4 tires were low. Everyone was ******* out for Halloween so I didn't have anyone tell. Realized on the drive home that the car had a torque converter shudder. Took it to a shop. They recommended I flush the trans fluid, BUT SilverRock doesn't cover it. So within a week of owning it, I'm out $300 and still might have to replace the torque converter or entire transmission. The intellilink in this car also has a MAJOR glitch. If that was the only issue, I wouldn't even complain because it's a cheap fix, but it's clearly not the only issue. My down-payment was charged to my account. They did NOT apply the previously stated $590 refund to my downpayment and charged my account for it.

I also found that they didn't even open the claim, they just refused to accept it. I got in touch with a nice lady from Carvana executive relations. She said she was ""surprised"" at all the issues. She even offered to contact ********** on a three-way call. So three of us are on the phone (me, Carvana's rep, and Silverrock). The Silverrock rep denied several times there was a claim until the Carvana rep pushed. However, they said the claim was not accepted.We get off the phone with ********** and the 'Executive Rep' says there is nothing Carvana can do if Silverrock doesn't want to pay. I said that there was something Carvana could do which would be to pay for the repair. She said that is something they would not do.",no response,No response

This is when the nightmare began.First , I kept getting emails and calls saying  I needed to submit proof of insurance and that what I had submitted wasn't good enough. So, I called my insurance company and spent over 30 minutes with an wonderful agent who put together a document showing  the car I was buying was going to be indeed insured. I then submitted this proof  to Carvana. Several hours later, I got an email from Carvana stating that my appointment to get the car had been cancelled because they hadn't received proof of insurance. So,  I got on the phone to talk to a live agent. After waiting  over an hour to talk to someone, I was finally connected to an agent, and I explained how unhappy I was and demanded to know why my appointment had been cancelled. After looking into the situation, she said that the policy I had submitted had a start date but that it didn't show when the policy ended. At this point, I became so ****** that I told her to cancel the entire order because Carvana's business practices ****. She agreed to cancel the order.Today, I got two emails from Carvana telling me that they were refunding my money for the purchase. These b******* took the money out of my account after I cancelled my order.

They are offering almost 2k less than the lowest trade in blue book value of our car. Now I understand they have to resell it, but trade in value calculates for that. Unfortunately there is no way to work out that deal, it's just whatever they decide to stick you with. In my opinion lowballing a car like that is not right, fair, or a good business practice.

Upon further investigation, I discovered that the trunk and antiskid buttons did not work. I was informed that I could make a warranty claim. We will see how that goes. Then, I decided to clean the windshield, and when I lifted the passenger side wiper arm, the wiper fell off. Upon further investigation, I determined that the connector for the windshield wiper blade to the wiper arm was the wrong one. When I reached out to Carvana, I was told that that would be an out-of-pocket expense and they would not take care of it. Again, there is no way a complete 150 point inspection was done on this vehicle. It should have never left the lot , and sent out for delivery until it was right! Do not buy from Carvana. They have lost my future business, and I would not recommend them!",no response,No response

Then when I got to my destination - an hour away from home - I looked at one of the front tires and it was chewed up and quite low tread. I looked at the other front tire and it was in the same condition. What?? ???? Now I'm an hour away from home and my mechanic and I have to drive on these tires stressing out and hoping I can make it home safely?? Then I bring it into my mechanic just to find out there was so much more that was wrong with it! Thankfully I got all but one issue fixed but seriously - how the h*** could carvana even let this be sold??? I can almost 100% guarantee that no one inspected it.

This stance is confounding given that we had owned the vehicle for only a few months, clearly indicating that these issues had been festering long before we became owners.In our attempts to rectify the situation, we've already invested $4,000, and our financial situation continues to deteriorate. The disparity between the car's current value and our outstanding balance exceeds $10,000, leaving us in an unenviable financial situation.While Carvana's car buying process *** appear quick and effortless on the surface, the hidden pitfalls and shortcomings become painfully evident after the purchase. The Carvana insurance and warranty, in particular, proved to be nothing more than empty promises.In conclusion, I want to emphasize that Carvana has left us in an inescapable predicament with a car that has drained our finances due to a relentless stream of issues. Carvana's unwillingness to address our concerns and refusal to honor their obligations is a ***** indication of their questionable business practices.",no response,No response

653,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,09/20/2023,Absolutely the worst way to buy a car. I recently bought a car from them and in 6 months there is a ticking noise coming from the engine. Called them to setup an appointment at silverrocks request. The mechanic says it needs a new engine now silverrock is refusing to do anything because they say it falls on the manufacturer warranty. But on carvanas website it says they are expired. Hence why I bought the extended warranty they them. The earliest the dealership can get me in is October 24. So a month with not being able to drive the car. Silverrock will only allow a ***** a day rental to a total of ****** that's a week and I have to pay up front and make a car payment on a car I can't drive and have to pay out of pocket for the dealership diagnostic which is ****** an hour. It is under a ******** miles so hopefully ******* fixes it. one star is all I'm going carvana for there lack of compassion and overall customer service. I would never buy a car from them again. ****** learned rather get screwed buy a local company then get screwed by this guy's again. Wish I could gave negative stars.

On 8/31, I was informed that upon transport, the side mirror had been knocked off and needed to be replaced, new delivery date was 9/8.  On 9/7, I was informed that the car had not yet been repaired and that the new date was 9/14.  When I FINALLY received my car, there was a HUGE scratch on the driver's side door, obviously from when the mirror was knocked off that clearly had been tried to be covered up.  Carvana did agree later to cover the cost of repair on the scratch.  After a full inspection, I was told that there was seepage on the transmission.  Did Carvana agree to pay for that being only the 4th day I'd had the car??......Of course not!  Unless I sent them a live video of the transmission fluid coming out and hitting the ground, they would not cover the $1,100 repair!Carvana is a joke!

I asked about the inspection that said all the systems passed and in fact they were easily found to be worn out, like the battery being old, so that I could not possibly have done that to the vehicle. Again I was met with the reply, its a used vehicle.

The first 1 was a ****** and I purchased it in 2020. The car has been good to me and Carvana sold it to me with a lot of brand new parts. The experience was good. Then I heard from mechanics that Carvana was starting to slack and not inspect cars properly anymore and the cars they were selling were literally lemons. I didnt believe it because I had a great experience with them so when my wife needed a new car we went with Carvana. HUGE mistake.2- We bought a 2016 ******* Tuccson with about 70k on in. My wife used to have a 2014 Tuccson with 115k on the odomoter and the car was awesome so we were confident with the purchase.We had to replace the battery right away, we needed 4 new tires, we needed a new wheel hub, the ac leaked (which we nobody is able to fix so literally my wife has no ac still in the car; we have brought it to so many shops and nobody can fix it properly). In their 150 point inspection they are supposed to check your car battery, your ac compressor, ac system leaks(we had and have a leak and had to replace the ac compressor as well), your tires,. So literally everything that we had to fix should have been replaced before selling us the car. Carvana has become a careless company.

My neighbors often complimented me on my truck also. Then the nightmare happened. I was at work and my door camera went off, and it was the police. They asked for me and my wife answered he is not here. They said it was very urgent to get in contact with me. They told her my truck is suspected to be a stolen truck with a duplicate title. The officer said that my license plate was cancelled. So just imagine if I was stopped by the police officer, I *** have lost my life. Being a black male of 64 stature I would have felt profiled. They would have said this is a stolen vehicle and I would have been arrested. I promise I would have not went quietly and things wouldve escalated, because there is no way I could have been financing a vehicle for one entire year that was stolen.

The Jeep was leaking transmission fluid from front to back. I was suggested to return the car because it was going to need a new transmission. Now mind you, the Auto Shop Carvana suggested **** Boys)  told me the car was fine. I used my better judgement and followed my first mind. I was about to be stuck with a Jeep that I'm paying a note for, with most of it's time in a shop. Please inspect your vehicle by someone you trust and not who Carvana suggest.

I called Carvana and was told to take it to a warranty repair shop. I did so and the claim was denied by the warranty company because ******** needed to file the claim in the first 7 days. I then spent several hours each on the phone with ******** and SilverRock (the warranty company) over the next few days trying to get the claim approved. After 8 days, I was told by ******** that they found an unknown error on my account and that my requests for the warranty repair were not submitting. I was told it would take 1-2 business days to resolve and that they could not cover my repair under warranty because the warranty period would be expired by then. I requested an extension of the warranty period due to the error on their side and the Caravana rep denied it. Classy move Carvana. Now I have a sun visor that fell off, no garage door opener (built in to the visor) and no vanity mirror/lights on the driver's side.

Fast forward now after pandemic and all the financial troubles in the news.  Much different company and not for the better.  Here is what I found has changed.  Most of the cars now have shipping charges.  Before, most had free shipping.  Of course shipping is non-refundable.  If you wanted to return the car during the 7 day period, they would pick it up and return trade if there was one.  Now you have to drive it back to the home office and your trade is not returned.  This causes you to lose the sales tax reduction on your next car!  You are supposed to get a check at time of return for any positive trade equity.  No.  They send it to you and of course not without repeated contacts with customer service to get that to happen.  Mine took two weeks!  Now for the big one if that is not already enough.  The 150 point inspection and cosmetic condition reporting are a major joke!  The car they gave me had a bald tire with a split in it.  A dent in two places, scratches and wood trim splitting on the interior.  Their imperfection pictures showed only two small chips on the hood!!  Finally, the interest rate on a loan was almost 2% higher compared to where I finally got the car I wanted from a regular dealer.  The car I ended up with was far better, less miles, more features and less expensive.  The ownership/management has changed this company attempting to maximize their profits taking advantage of us!  That's why they can now report positive quarter earnings.  But look at the reviews of this company now.  It's littered with all sorts of complaints.  It's being run like a company who knows they are going out of business!!  For me, that can't come soon enough!  Never again would I even consider them as a buying alternative.

We were told the refund would take **** business days. 10 business days from July 4th would have been July 18th yet today. Both my father and I called Carvana countless times to get the refund.

He proceeded to text me so that I could be in contact with him directly yet his only response to my texts was that he was out of the office later never responded at all. On July 26th, we were told that the refund ticket was processed and would take 3-5 business days. On August 1st, the 5th business day, guess what happened? Still no refund. My father called Carvana and they said they couldn't assist him because he didn't remember his email. I called them and got someone by the name of ***** on the phone. Keep in mind that August 1st makes it 20 business. ***** told us that Carvana never requested the draft from the financial institution. After all of the back and forth with them, after all of the phone calls of false, useless information that took place, we finally find out that all we have to do is get the cancellation of draft letter and get it to the financial institution.

Easy to view and compare vehicles, and I understand the Cars are overpriced and probably because I am paying for convenience. I have the choice to shop anywhere, so that issue does not bother me. The issues started after the drop of the car. Immediately the front rotors were bad, there was a lot of vibration in the steering wheel. I called them up, and they told me to bring it to a preferred mechanic, and they covered the expense. The following day the car began bucking and eventually became stuck in 3rd gear. I again brought it to the preferred mechanic, who informed me the transmission was bad and needs to be replaced. They commented that it was ridiculous that they sold a car like that, especially because it was throwing codes. I contacted Carvana, and they told me they would fix it. However, no one buys a car to replace the transmission. I started the return process. Essentially they tell you that It's my responsibility to find a new car, reapply for financing (Which is ridiculous because my interest rate went up because of the second hit), and finish the sale, and then they would move the down payment. I have never been in a process where the dealer sold me a lemon but made it my problem. It hurt my credit, I am now paying more for the car. On top of that, while speaking to their advocates, I was disconnected multiple times and I would receive answers that were completely not related to me. Example: I was speaking about the issues with my car and received an answer to bring my car to safelight auto glass. They have nothing to do with transmissions. Overall the experience was awful.

784,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,07/17/2023,Absolutely horrible experience! We had purchased one vehicle that went relatively smoothly - then wanted to purchase another. We took out the loan and ordered the car. When they delivered the car they thought we were returning another car (we were not- or there would have been no reason to take out another loan). So - they took the car back. It has been over 10 days - they have the money from our loan - and have not returned it to the bank. So they have our money and the car! We are still in the market for another car - but they have not been able to tell us when the money would be returned to the bank. Their story doesn't hold water - if they thought we were returning a car - why take the second loan. Since they took back the car - why process our loan. Never again!! I guess there is something to be said for going to a dealership and getting that extra bit of human service. Buyer beware - do NOT buy a car from Carvana!,no response,No response

Often not receiving an update my delivery would be changed until 30 minutes prior to the appointment.

Hung up with customer service to receive a text they were on the way to pick up the car. The best experience I had with their staff was the woman that dropped off and picked up the car, she was pleasant and apologetic.

I waited several days and again contacted customer service and was told ""it doesn't work that way, you have to request the documents to receive them...""

I am a person just like many of you Im sure that needs to have two sets of keys.  Its not a convenience, its a requirement, a necessity.

We were called 3x because they did not like the way the back of the drivers license photo came thru. while on the phone for more than 2.5 hours my husband asked of all was set for the trade in and purchase to come thru/pick-up/drop off on the same day. The guy said yes. They dropped the new car but did not pick up the trade-in. They said the paperwork for the trade in was incomplete. We did both together to save $1000 +. The savings was the tax savings and the delivery and pick up fee for 2 different vehicles. So again they called multiple times about the photo of the drivers license but failed to call about not having incomplete paperwork........Their solution was to return the purchased car (we would have to eat the delivery/shipping fee). reorder the same car and process it with the trade-in and have to pay the delivery fee again. They would pick up the returned car, inspect it and then reprocess it all again. Environmentally, financially, and from a resources perspective, that seems like bad business, bad customer service, and the lack of responsibility for confirming all was in order to begin with ultimately made us drop the entire thing - we have returned the car and will never do business with Carvana again. - TRULY DISAPPOINTED!",no response,No response

It was a complete disaster and no one on their end cared enough to help assist me in getting the mistake resolved.  While I have a trail of documents and written online chat records acknowledging their mistake, they continued to talk about their policies of keeping the money and allowing the refund process to take place (2 weeks).  This is within minutes of the autodraft.  Hard to understand how it could not be stopped or canceled.  I was told my request had been elevated to the highest levels within the organization and a senior manager would call me as soon as possible.  I never received a call.  In addition, they lost the plates that were supposed to be mailed to me.  The representative was insistent that the plates were mailed with the registration sticker.  I gave him several opportunities to confirm or track the package.  He could not.  Only after I asked him to explain how the sticker arrived w/o plates did he acknowledge that he was only assuming and didn't know for sure.  Unacceptable to have customer service agents who lie to customers who've spent tens of thousands of dollars on a vehicle.  In addition, it is now up to me to resolve this issue on my own and incur additional cost for the plates that I already paid for.

Help on the weekend was spotty with incorrect info on registration. Weekday support was better. Carvana was also not clear that the car was not inspected before arrival.Delivery was fine. Within time period of warranty and miles a tire bulged and needed replacement. Was told these are considered replaceable and were not covered. I feel this covers Carvana from needing to replace any tires/belts/seals and pass along the responsibility to the customer.  You can only predict so much but thoroughly check your car on arrival. Would be nice to think they would cover a few tires/parts here and there for their reputation but not the case.,no response,No response

Went through the normal purchase process and opted to pick up vehicle at a vending machine, vice a home delivery, because of travel time constraints. The night before we received a text stating that the delivery would be delayed by five days. I spoke with a customer service representative and they gave me three different excuses throughout the conversation. One excuse was that my insurance coverage had a glitch, which I new was not the case. Next was a shipping delay excuse, which I had already countered by offering to drive an hour to pick up the car at the vending machine and since I was told the car was already there. The last excuse was due to personnel shortages at various locations. Since I was planning to use the vehicle for a vacation trip I was forced to cancel that order and start a new order on a vehicle that was promised to be delivered within two days since all the paperwork was done.  All I had to do was change the vehicle on my insurance coverage and this time the car would be delivered to my door. Two days later and one hour into the delivery window I received the repeat text that this car was also delayed another five days due to shipping complications and personnel shortages.

So.I traded in my car to Carvana in May(2023)and to my demise, the first car they gave me had serious transmission issues plus the engine light was always on. I contacted them and let them know and a swap was done. HOWEVER,the second car I got was even worse! Just moments after leaving the Lexington,SC hub with the second car, I realized the car had serious transmission issues,it jerked and even accelerated on its own. I immediately called Carvana and started having dialogues with them about swapping again. I was told that it couldnt be done that day and that I would have to wait until the Monday to schedule a swap. This would be my final swap so I pondered then opted to take the car to a shop through Bridgecrest(as recommended by Carvana). The advocate assured me that he would extend the 7 day return policy but as unscrupulous as he could be, he extended the policy while the car was not in my possession and it while it was  deemed not driveable. When the shop returned the car to me,the problem was not fixed so I again called Carvana and informed them about the issues,clearly stating also my intention to swap. To my surprise,my 7 day policy was expired so I got stuck with the car! I was stressed. Anyway,I tried to make it. I have tried negotiating with Carvana but they keep telling me that they DO NOT NEGOTIATE. The only thing they recommended was to take the car to a workshop that accepts SilverRock ( their insurance). I did this twice but as stated before the car had serious issues so it was never really fixed.

Wrong with your car there wont be anything to speak to. Customer support isnt any kind of support at all.

I purchased a Golf GTI that got delayed 3 times and outright canceled once over a ""technical glitch"" creating even more delays. Each delay occurred the day before expected delivery. Every time this happened, Carvana wanted updated paperwork showing different dates for insurance coverage in order to reflect the new pickup date. Meanwhile, my insurance company (State Farm) was very confused over this strict requirement and each change really messed up the totals of my insurance payments and coverage. I've complained about this to Carvana and they seem tone deaf to the core issue of them over promising and under-delivering. I'd much rather be told the car is ready when it's ready rather than hearing multiple false promises only to be let down multiple times.Once the vehicle was finally delivered, it reeked of smoke, the windshield wipers were mounted in the reverse order and both the *** and engine lights kept turning on the dash. I had the vehicle inspected by a reputable euro mechanic which took way longer to schedule and exceeded Carvana's 7 day return policy. Once the mechanic got a chance to look over the vehicle, they discovered OIL LEAKING INTO THE COOLANT SYSTEM!!! I contacted Carvana about this issue to express concern over them missing this problem before selling the car to me. They made it abundantly clear that they could care less. They deferred to their limited warranty company which isn't even covering half of the costs of the needed repairs. It feels like their staff is trained to by hyper positive while ignoring all serious customer concerns which results in a very frustrating customer experience.I'm not thrilled over this outcome, especially when I'm paying over 20k for a car that risked complete engine failure out the door.

Problems were: Aftermarket exhaust with holes in it(exhaust leaks), Front brake pads are worn so bad to set a warning light/LR rim is bent/ cabin and engine air filters are horrible/there is a draw on the battery. I wanted carvana to fix these issues because i love the car and don't want to return it, but i was told this was not an option. So i have the 13 mini set up to return and i swapped it out for another mini(this time having to pay $590 for shipping). The 13 Mini passed a ** state inspection done by carvana right before sale. Exhaust leaks and worn brake pads don't wear out over a few days. I'm really concerned about how carvana does state inspections in ************** as this car shouldn't have passed the safety inspection.Update: called them and found out that there was a technical issue with 11mini and it was delayed. I then cancelled it because of how bad this process has been, only to realize i would lose $500 in taxes if i just took my positive equity. I then wanted to keep the 11 mini(i realize this part was my fault). The guy set me up for a 6/3 delivery. The paperwork said 6/10. The 11 mini is at the concord location and is ready but now can't deliver it until 6/11. Spent hours on the phone only to be told i can't get the 11 mini this week. I have to pay $590 shipping for a comparable car at no fault of my own. I have to go more than a week without a vehicle. The shipping fee isn't that big of deal, id settle if they just let me get my car. Carvana great idea/people, horrible execution and management.",no response,No response

I got the highest offer to sell my car from Carvana after comparing multiple offers, I decided to go this route. They market themselves as being convenient, but this has been anything but. Sure, they give high offers, but they make it impossible to retrieve. My drop off option was over 2 hours away, so I opted for pick up which cost $100. Figured that $100 was worth my time and hassle. Within 2 weeks, I have been rescheduled THREE times. They have had to extend my offer which dropped by $700 even though the timing was on them. They offered to reimburse my pick up fee, but will not simply waive it. The amount of time and money I have wasted on the phone with them trying to get a pick up scheduled is ridiculous. Their excuse is the same everytime- ""they don't have the staff"" yet they are sure to tell you about all the ways and third parties they use to follow through with pick **** Also, if you do not have the staff, why is pick-up an option? Why are there dates and times you offer when you cannot follow through? The first time they rescheduled was 10 minutes AFTER my pick up time. The other times were less than 24hrs. Each time requires the customer to change their schedule, remove plates and belongings from their car, and is a complete inconvenience when it does not happen. When I ask to speak to a supervisor, they tell me it will take over 14 HOURS for them to get back to me. They are leaving their customer service representatives in terrible positions because not even they can get any response from higher **** or hubs, in a timely manner. I will stray anyone away from carvana immediately. Save your time and money.

When my partner bought a car from Carvana, we discovered multiple marks and scratches that were conveniently omitted from the photos and not disclosed as vehicle problems. Similarly, I personally considered buying a car from them, adding it to my cart, but I didn't sign any documents. The car was scheduled to arrive a month later, so no shipping had taken place yet. However, due to issues with obtaining my temporary license in a new state I was relocating to, I realized I couldn't proceed with the purchase. I contacted Carvana's customer service, seeking assurance that the car would be canceled and I would receive a full refund, including the shipping fee of $990. To our dismay, they have now informed me that they will not refund the shipping fee, despite the fact that no shipment had occurred.

When we got home called customer service and were told to take it to one of their repair facilities (closest one 1 1/2 hours away) and it would cost us a $100 for them to look at the tires and see if they needed replacement.

Once I get no where with either I'm transferred and put on hold for massive amounts of time. The used car I purchased was supposed to be delivered on a Thursday and that morning they called stating the check engine light went on after it was inspected/detailed and ready to go on the road.  I opted to have them check the problem but to notify me before doing anything.  No one every got back to me until I went through the text messages and extensive wait times to f/u.  I ultimately canceled because they started repairs BEFORE telling me anything and couldn't even tell me what mechanic it was at so I could f/u myself.  2 weeks later I canceled with so much frustration and wasted time.  VERY unprofessional and the lack of communication is phenomenal.  To top things off, AFTER i canceled the car all together, I got a letter stating that I'm denied a loan at this time because of my credit score??  Which was something like 678 ish?!

We have still not received the title (march 2022-may 2023) Within 2 months the transmission locked up in first gear. Carvana told us tough luck because while it was inside the warranty time frame it was over the mileage by **** miles. It was upsetting as we were stuck with a $5000 bill after a $5000 down payment. Carvana ""special teams"" reached out after a BBB complaint. They strung us along for 6 months telling us they would take care of the issue.  During that time our first and second contacts handling the issue quit and changed jobs. This required me and the shop it was at to send the same paperwork at least 6 times because carvana kept losing it or a new person assigned to us could not find it. Our first contact was very helpful but also gave us an insight to the company. He was working 2 other jobs but told us how much of a mess the company was internally. There is almost no contact between teams and departments. Every time we would call I would be transferred between 3 departments minimum to reach our contact. After the 6 months of constant back and forth, and them telling us they would fix it, they told us it had been too long and they weren't going to help us. I understand that it was outside the warranty but they strung us along for months telling us they would help us. They swear up and down that the title for the car we've been paying for for a year is at the *** an hour away. We've been there 4 times and they have no idea what we are talking about. That *** has a separate phone number for carvana and not once have we been able to get someone to pick up the phone after ***** calls.

The next day underwriting tells me they could not proceed with the loan because his last name is hyphenated and only one last name is on his paychecks. They gave us 24 hours or they would cancel the order. I contacted customer service and was told they could approve me for the loan. I had already submitted my income verification as a co signer. We went on his Carvana account and cancelled the order and replaced it under my account with me as the loan applicant. What the rep never mentioned was that they had already processed the first downpayment of $7500 to our bank account. I didnt even think to ask because why would a company take your downpayment on a loan that they havent approved you for. Secondly I was not asked if I had $15000 in my account to cover these 2 transactions. So when I repurchased the car they again processed $7500 which resulted in an overdraft of my checking account for thousands of dollars. Carvana assured me I would receive a refund for the downpayment on the first cancelled order. I expressed concern that my bank would probably refuse the payment for my purchase because I did not have the funds. I was told not to worry the rep checked the system twice and my downpayment had been received. When I checked my bank account, the next day everything looked good. There was only one transaction and I assumed it had been fixed. I even received an email from Carvana telling me to get excited! My car was being prepared and everything was in place.

I asked the cause of the leak, told we dont do that herein snotty tone. The lady became more unprofessional which also made the situation worse.   The jeep was brought to us and I started inspecting it. Crawled underneath and checked that the oil leak was fixed.  Looked as if a new oil pan and gasket were put on.  The radio was replaced with a lower model with no satellite radio,  and the windshield was never replaced, in fact the out of state registration sticker was still on the windshield.    I decided to check the oil, there was no oil on the dip stick.    So I started it up and let it run, the engine started to smoke.  I told the associate there is no oil in this vehicle.  She looked at me and said PLEASE just reject it and be on your way.  I then called corporate and they told me the same thing but she said just drive and get oil.

I also reminded him that it was not my fault that the Carvana app was sluggish. He just smirked at me.  I asked him why he and the other advocate waited to tell me after I finally got the documents signed.  He just shrugged his shoulders and walked away. I cannot understand why Carvana chose to lose a customer who paid in full because advocates thought the customer took too long to sign the e-documents.  I still do not know where the orginal advocate went. I now have to cancel the car insurance on this canceled car and wait for a refund (up to 10 days) before I can start looking for another car.",no response,No response

I used their 7 day return policy between two new cars they changed the pick up date 5 different times. Once I finally got the vehicle that worked for me and everything seemed dandy until they pulled $781.50 out of my account AGAIN. I had paid my down payment out of one institutions account and they pulled the money out of a completely other bank institution I use. Taking my account into the negative and now I am unable to make my car payment. I called them told them what happened and asked why it happened. She couldnt give me an answer instead told me they confirmed it was a duplicate and it will take 3-5 bd to return. They took no ownership of anything no one apologized for what had happened no one even admitted it was a mistake. I told the representative I was frustrated that no one has even apologized and she said I am sorry no one has apologized to you but they are working on fixing the problem.

Started out trying to finance through my local credit union, but due to Carvana's backwards business practices, was unable to get the title for the vehicle in a reasonable amount of time so the bank said it was a no go. I tried financing through 3 other major financial institutions and none of them were willing to work with Carvana. I really wanted this vehicle so I worked out a deal with my parents where they would pay for the vehicle in full with a cashier's check and once the title was in hand, I would then finance through my local credit union. Problem solved, right? WRONG. I sent pictures of the check as I was instructed to do so and scheduled my first delivery date. The next day my personal checking account was charged for the full amount of the vehicle (even though pictures of the cashier's check had already been sent), which left my account 33k in the red. I spent hours on the phone trying to get this issue resolved. After speaking with a 4th Carvana representative, I was able to get the issue resolved.

Fast forward to 2 days before my delivery and I get an email saying the delivery is delayed and forced me again to reschedule. This happened THREE other times. Frustrated, I called Carvana back to see what the deal was. After being transferred multiple times, an extremely rude gentleman told me there was nothing they could do and my only option was to continue waiting. I then asked where the vehicle was and was told they did not know. I asked if there were any assurances that my truck would actually get delivered on my FOURTH scheduled delivery date and was told it was possible it could potentially get delayed again.

The interior was trashed like a homeless person lived in it. Dog drool and hair caked in every crevice. Parts and pieces missing everywhere. I fixed what I could because of how new the car was. Then came the trunk leak. Had the car garaged til Spring and never knew it had an existing leak. Everything in the trunk was destroyed. Replaced everything, but it still leaked.

I traded it for the same car with lower mileage that was cheaper. It was a huge hassle. They could have just given me back the difference in the cars's price, but that is not how their systems works. The second car needed a clamp put on the exhaust line that was audibly rattling and the car needed an alignment. Carvana's checklist stated that there were no issues with these things, so the car was essentially misrepresented on their site like the first car I had purchased, so 2/2 misrepresentation. I was stuck with the costs of the repairs due to Carvana's convoluted warranty system for mechanical repairs. It has to be submitted to the warranty provider by a mechanic and there is a $100 deductible. In other cases the deductible could be waived if the claim was submitted through Carvana, but because Carvana won't take accountability and says that the claim has to be submitted by a mechanic there is no way around the deductible for a car I purchased 6 days earlier. The only option would have been to return the car again. Honestly, I'm tired of the whole thing and essentially am giving up and eating the cost. It's taken too much time and energy.

Currently I have ****** miles on my car. The problems didn't start until mid February of this year (2023) and they have been non stop since then. My transmission went out and I had it towed to a transmission shop which repaired the transmission. The tow and the repair were covered by the Silverock warranty at no cost to me. Less than a week later reverse went out and then the whole transmission went out again. Same scenario as before but now I am being told by the transmission shop that the problem is probably being caused by the module which has to be repaired at a **** dealer. I called the local **** dealer and was told that based on the problems I described it was probably not the module but the actuators which the transmission shop replaced. I was then told that the actuators go out because they are inside the transmission and they go out because of corrosion. I have been able to use my car for 4 days since mid February.

After some self advocacy, I got customer service to agree to reimburse me for a new charger. A couple days go by for me to get the charger from Amazon. I find out that the car doesn't go even half the amount of miles it's rated to go on battery.  Now the 7 day warranty is nearing a close. 2 more chats with customer service and they keep giving me contact info for auto shops that don't even deal with electrics. Back to customer service, explaining the story each time. They tell me to contact the warranty 3rd party, Silver Rock, which tells me I'd have to pay $100 for an in network auto shop, $300 if out of network. The closest in network shop that can assess a plug in hybrid is 30 minutes away. So my options are to spend $100, a bunch of time, and $ to Uber back to my house because they won't cover those fees or a rental while the shop has the car. Meanwhile, I have to go back to customer service to do more self advocacy to extend the 7 day warranty. Meanwhile, I find an inspection check list in the glove, but only ~ a dozen things are checked off, not 150 like Carvana advertises. I press customer service to see the ***** inspection report and THEY FINALLY COME CLEAN THAT IT WAS NOT DONE!  After catching them with false advertising, you'd think they'd make it really easy to return the car. NOPE! It would be 3 days for the car to be picked up and I have to insure it until it's out of my hands. They can't refund the check from my bank they cashed for another week or two. That leaves me to take out a second loan in order to buy another car. Day of pick up, no one reaches out to me. I contact customer service at 9am, again at 11am, and again at 12:30.

1023,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,03/10/2023,"Carvana has lost a customer and we're probably not the only one.  The car was delayed so we had to take off work to pick it up.  When we got there, it wasn't ready and we had to wait quite a while.  The dealership was dirty, the work was sloppy, and nothing was ready.  When we drove it off the lot we noticed that the windshield wipers would need to be replaced which was annoying but not the end of the world so we planned to replace them.  The next morning we go to get in the car and the tire light was on.  The tires are supposed to be inflated to 32 psi.  The back tires were at 42 & 43, the front driver at 34 and the front passenger at 21!  We contacted Carvana and they told us to get in touch with SilverRock their service provider but that we would have to pay a $100 deductible.  It was very clear to us that someone inflated the tire long enough to get it off the lot.  I asked multiple times if they would be willing to waive the deductible considering this was a preexisting issue and they were unwilling to budge.  We took it to a local trusted mechanic and come to find out it was in the interior wall and he confirmed there's almost no chance that they wouldn't have known about it.  Their 150 pt inspection apparently is just a good idea instead of something they actually check.  Also, they left an invoice in the car that shows major work (catalytic converter replaced) was done and the carfax only shows routine maintenance.  Our first experience with Carvana 6 years ago was great but the past several times we've used them they've gotten worse and worse and now with their unwillingness to waive a $100 as the least they could possibly do for all the hassle we are DONE using them and will not recommend them ever again to anyone.

I went to a second in network shop and was told the same thing Carvana boosts about how easy their process is but, as expected, is a scam. They are misleading people with their warranties by saying any issues, just take it in to our in network repair shops yet they dont say that its a whole process that was related to health insurance whatever that means. I will now have to pay out of pocket for my own engine issues as i have reached out to carvana several times and have been told they dont know anything about the warranty company and to contact the warranty company (who then tells me to contact carvana). I have a written estimate on what needs to be repaired.. and those items are explicitly covered by their warranty company (they have a list of what they cover online) yet somehow its a problem to have it fixed on the weekend.

Anytime I had an issue the date had to be changed in order to fix it. Then, finally my date comes up, and they have no one to deliver it. I paid two unrefundable delivery charges and was told to either drive 150 miles to pick it up myself or change delivery date with no way of confirming someone would be on staff to deliver even at the new date. Then my car was actually NOT 150 miles away but only 44 miles away. Then it was that cars are not allowed to be picked up but must be delivered so they changed the date. Then it was oh, your car actually can be picked up but you changed the delivery date so now you will have to wait.

We didnt see any body damage to either vehicles so I signed for the car and took it directly to my mechanic to check it out. Many issues were found. The tires on a 4WD were all mismatched and there was no maintenance record of when they were added so while the tread was fine, we couldnt rule out dry rot. The steering wheel was off center and pulled to the right and the front tire roters were rusted and needed to be fully replaced. In addition, I found a crack in the windshield that wasnt noted anywhere, the car wasnt clean/detailed and it arrived with less than a quarter tank of gas and a nasty AC and oil filter. Justbasic things that any inspection wouldve found.

Instead of fighting with their claims team to try to get the repairs made, I decided to return the car. I have zero reason to trust that Carvana would care enough about me as a customer or my experience to help me with repairs, and have first hand knowledge from other Carvana buyers that they do everything they can to not pay for repairs to the vehicles they sell.

They said they would resubmit the * title and i would be good to go. I then messaged  Carvana's text line and then again another message saying they will not except my e title and that they needed a paper title.  I called back to Carvana and once again they stated they were sorry that they do not except paper * titles and once again i had explained that i did not have a paper title and that i was told by two prior associates that this would be taken care of, now the associate i called said the same thing as the last two associates, but stated that i had nothing to worry about and i would get my vehicle on Wednesday 22.

Carvana claims they do a 150 inspection and I dont think they do that at all because I was also told no one at vending machine is a machanic so how would they be able to diagnose a problem with a vehicle just seems very sketchy. I think carvana should be ashamed how they are not only wasting people's time they're also wasting people money on broken promises by ******* some to get in all the paperwork they need from you when they cant even deliver a vehicle.

The associate that contacted me tried to reschedule a drop off for 2/20 and scheduled it for 2/27 and Carvana would do nothing about the fact that I would be without a car for an extended amount of time because they didnt check on the car a couple days before hand to check for any issues. After talking to the associate a few times I asked if I could see the vehicle the day it was supposed to be delivered and see if I even wanted to go through with it and he agreed then called me back saying the vehicle didnt even turn on.

Well Friday 1:30 no car. I message there chat during the time frame asking for an update. I called and asked there representatives for clarification. First I was told they came two hours early and nobody was home, then I was told they came 15 minutes late and nobody was home. They also claimed to have called (no missed calls on my end). I then asked how to get it redelivered as I was home waiting for them. I was told they couldnt get ahold of the local hub and would call me back. Fast forward 6 hours later. I was informed by ****** ( a member of management) they upheld there obligation and Id have to wait and additional 6 days for the delivery. I chose to cancel and was then informed it would also take 5 days to refund my money.

Complained to an online advocate and Carvana said it was past the 5day window to do a transfer so I have a new registration instead which I basically had to eat the cost of a new registration vs transferring my current one. I warned the advocate to send my new registration/plate to my address where Im station, they sent a msg to their registration team to do so. Contacted again when I did not see ***** route to my station state, they said they will follow up and ensure it gets re-routed. Contacted again since my plates were delivered to the wrong address, they told me Carvana did everything they are suppose to do and it was vendors fault but asked me to fix it since I didnt contact them sooner which took me by surprised since I mentioned it day 1 when I picked up the car. Advocate said well the clerk took pics and did not notate it properly so they only seen on Day5 I contacted them about it. The options they gave me was get a duplicate plate from dmv or get it at the address it was sent which is states away.

Everything went smoothly until I failed to get the license plate by the time the temporary one expired on Dec 18, 2022. **** from the senior support team has been assigned to handle my case. On Dec 22, 2022, he notified me that the paperwork was with DMV and that I should expect to receive my license plate anytime soon. A month went by and it never arrived. So I went to a nearby DMV in an attempt to get a temporary license plate and only to find out that they never received the paperwork from Carvana. Carvana previously advised me that they sent DMV a ***** package which showed it having been delivered on Dec 22, 2022. However, a month went by and no one from Carvana bothered to check with DMV to ensure that the ""paperwork"" had been processed. Because of this oversight by Carvana, I have not been able to get a temporary license plate which enables me to operate my vehicle legally. When I contacted Carvana immediately after my visit with DMV on Jan 19, 2023, I was given another run-around again and was told by another senior manager that ****, my rep, would call me back the next morning. Again, no phone call from **** so I waited until 3pm to make another call. I had to repeat the same story that I told his co-worker the day prior in order to bring him up to speed about the status - letting him know that DMV has not received the ""paperwork"" from Carvana or the third-party in order to transfer the title of the vehicle to my name. When he was not able to provide an explanation, I let him know that I want my money back so I could use the proceeds to purchase another vehicle for transportation. He agreed and told me that he had initiated the request from the finance department and should have an answer for me next Tues. When I called him back on Jan 24, he was on another call, but his co-worker let me know that my account is ""being researched."" No one can tell me what it means!",no response,No response
1087,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,01/25/2023,"If you're on the fence about buying a car from Carvana, don't. The experience started off easy. They list imperfections on the listing after the car goes through there ""150 point inspection"", documents were signed fairly easier and pickup date was set. Upon pickup the car had more damage then was listed on the website, every panel had imperfections, scratch's and/or dents. In light of all this and dragging two of my friends 4 hours away I took the car and thought to myself I can use my warranty when i'm back home the next day. Also I did not get a vehicle test drive, the keys were handed to me and I was told to have a good night. After having the car in my position for only 1 hour, the transmission failed leaving me stranded on the side of the road for 3 hours while I was waiting on a flatbed to take back to Long Island. Carvana's warranty only covers up to $300 on the tow so I had to come out of pocket another almost $800 bringing the total to bring it home $1,100. The next day they gave the greenlight for my shop to order almost $5,000 in parts. Putting the car on the lift there was multiple issues that should of been caught by there ""150 point inspection"". Car was inoperable for over 9 days. After getting it back, I had to get it towed 3 times due to issues with the vehicle. I asked Carvana to return the car but was told after 7 days of having it (not driving it) I am for lack of a better term s*** out of luck. So now I submitted a claim to fix all the remaining items but because it wasn't reported in the first 7 days they can not do anything more. I didn't have the car for the first 10 days of ownership, they did not care. Now leaving me with a damaged car that I will have to come out of pocket to fix. Also the registration process took over 60 days to complete! I wanted to give Carvana a fair shot & look past the bad reviews but it did not help. Save the headache & buy local. This was the worst car buying/ownership experience I've ever had to deal with.",no response,No response

1089,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,01/24/2023,"I purchased a certified pre-owned 2021 vehicle from Carvana on 12/6/2022. The vehicle had a nail in the back passenger tire that we did not find until after we got home from the car vending machine. It is our only vehicle so we needed to get it replaced ASAP. The tire shop noticed the tread on all 4 tires was considerably low even though the Carvana 150-point inspection stated otherwise. We had him replace the back tires and decided to wait on the front until we finalized our decision to keep the vehicle (Carvana gives you 7 days to return after you purchase). We submitted a claim for reimbursement to SilverRock the following day. We paid ~$580. We loved the vehicle and wanted to keep it, but ********** did not get back to us before the 7 day trial period. They approved the claim for the front 2 tires to be replaced due to low tread, so we assumed they would approve the back. We had the front 2 tires replaced on 12/27/2023 - SilverRock covered the entire cost, no issues. They got back to us on 1/24/2023 with their findings on the back 2 tires. They stated that they would only replace the tire with the nail but not the other since the tread was a few decimal places off from being within the acceptable range for SilverRock to replace. The folks at Carvana stated that I should have checked with SilverRock before getting the back tires replaced and they apologized for passing the tread on all 4 tires on the inspection. Their reasoning was ""human error."" I ended up only getting reimbursed for half of the full amount. I used a credit card to purchase the back tires, so I also had to pay interest since it took over a month for SilverRock to process. **********'s team was not easy to work with. I had to consistently follow up, explaining the situation with a new rep every time. Carvana's customer service team simply pushed me over to SilverRock, so it was a vicious and very time-consuming cycle. Both Carvana and SilverRock let me down.",no response,No response

Audi was a bad car and had to return. They gave me my Jeep back, though within the 5 days it was with them they had registered it under their name and transferred title. In the subsequent month I spent several hours a week with their customer service on the phone, several hours at DMV. They first told me to get titles back under my name which DMV refused, then told me go for a trade in again with them, then said I couldnt do that, eventually and painfully I HAD TO sell my jeep to them.

And don't think you are safe with their Carfax report, and their 60-whatever point inspection. Unless a company signs up for the *************** accidents will not show up on the car's record! I had to buy a new battery within two months of buying the car, I had to get the window motor replaced and window realigned, and due to the realignment, needed to pay $100 to re-tint the window. I also just learned one of the rims is bent, there goes another $250. And don't even get me started on their so-called warranty program with Silverrock, WHAT A JOKE! When you try to use it, the businesses they send you to don't want to deal with them and say it takes forever to get work done. They like to push it out so it falls past the offered warranty, or it takes to long, you'll give up and pay for it yourself, (OR) they tell you that it is ""normal wear & tear"" and they won't replace it.

Another tire had a gash on the interior, not noticeable to the standard user. None of the tires are correct for this vehicle.*The emergency brake had amateur repairs to it which could cause it to fail.So far, and this is an ongoing process, Carvana has only agreed to pay for the ignition switch repairs, claiming the others are ""wearable/replaceable"" parts.

They are now asking for $1,300 more down for a car I've been paying on since September. The outcome of this hurts financially and the commitments and promises (all documented) were broken. A senior rep for Carvana also felt this was not right after I reached out to her 2 days ago.  Details;The ******6 started a rebuild in Oct and was just completed 11 days ago.

They are now asking for an additional $1,300 towards the down payment. I did sign the updated rebuild contract thinking that the only change was the registration from Pa to De. The change in registration was the reason for the rebuild.  I had this vehicle for 3 months now and have made all payments on time or early. They are now saying I cannot get my registration extended or updated until the $1,300 additional down payment is paid in full.  That said, my temp- registration expires on December 20th.

I support myself and my daughter, and I care for my mother who has severe dementia in my home without any assistance and I need a vehicle to do all of that. Tomorrow marks two months since I purchased a car and its honestly the worst car buying experience Ive ever had. The single star is only because the staff, for the most part, were friendly. I waited 2 weeks to receive the car and traveled just 15 miles before an engine malfunction message came on. Not feeling comfortable driving up a mountain to one of their approved mechanics, and being unable to go without a vehicle while the assessed the problem, repaired it and waited for paperwork, I opted to select another vehicle. I waited 2 weeks for that vehicle and at almost the exact same place on the highway the engine message came on. I decided maybe that model was the problem and went with the smaller model I had for 2 years before without issue and had high hopes I would soon be done with all of this. Two more weeks and the car arrived, but Carvana had added a $1600 down payment to the deal without advising me and I didnt notice it on the 15th rendition of the contract. Im a pretty patient person and had been extremely understanding during this process, even referring a friend who purchased a vehicle while dealing with this, but Im not going to allow them to bully me out of money that was not part of the original deal. And, this car is valued lower than either of the ones with engine trouble. They were retuning my trade in on the 28th,  then it was moved to the 1st.

This car has had so many mechanical issues with only 14k miles. Carvana has been no help. They dont care. I kick myself for buying through this company and do not recommend them to anyone. Im out so much money and time. Time spent on phone crying and fighting. The 150 check Or whatever they call it is a joke! No car this new with this low of miles should be having so many issues. My car went from going 70 miles a hour on highway to 20 miles and then shutting off completely on multiple occasions.  Totally unsafe! Do they care ? NO!

First time was because they couldn't verify my information in a timely manor causing me to have to wait past the offer deadline.

Pick up date came and like I said they rescheduled it due to shortage of workers calling me at the time they were supposed to arrive! Came to second pick up appointment and said ****** is over due to their issues and lowered my offer, not my fault I needed a vehicle. Since they didn't have the proper check they needed to reschedule AGAIN!! 3rd pick up appointment they sent me a message saying my appointment has been reschedule. They didn't even ask just sent me a new date and time. I got a call from the driver the day of the 3rd up appointment and said on the way. So confused and not even at home I forwarded the message that the company rescheduled my appointment without consulting me, they didn't even tell the driver! 4th pick up appointment would cause me to miss work again, I canceled pick up appointment. The message I get is if I cancel (no fault of mine) they will adjust my offer again. Original offer was $5000 more then the last offer I had.

But returning the car under a 7 day warranty was very problematic. We returned the car to them a few days after we bought it and got a new vehicle from them.

Once Carvana finally paid off the loan we realized the total was incorrect and they left out interest. I called Carvana and they refused to pay the interest.

We were forced to secure insurance on the vehicle one week prior to delivery, which was to be 11/19/22 - EVEN THOUGH the state of MS does not require this. We submitted a delivery address which was a business location in a town about 1 hr away, in order to save a 3-hr drive to a vending location. A representative called about 1 week out and said there was a problem with the address. Carvana can't deliver to a location that is not your residence. We thought delivery was not available to our home; however, she typed in the address and said it could and would be done. Approximately 2 days prior to delivery, we received a phone call stating that the delivery was delayed. They pushed the delivery back a full week. Updated delivery date - 11/28/22. We confirmed the address for delivery and they stated our home address. THESE CALLS WERE RECORDED, as they all are. Let me add... with every change (delivery date, etc.), we had to RESIGN contracts. And all of these steps were extremely time-sensitive. On the morning of 11/28, we received text messages and phone calls stating that everything was in order and they would head our direction as we signed a final POA document which needed to be notarized. We completed that step. Approximately 1 hr later, we were contacted by the courier who stated he was at that business location an hour away (the initial delivery address that they could not do). We told him he had the wrong delivery address. 2 customer service employees called with no help offered other than to say we were ""outside their delivery zone."" They asked us to give them some time to review our notes, etc., and get back to us on a solution. More than 24 hrs later, we have received no additional information and it appears that our order has been cancelled on the website. What incredibly POOR service.

I bought a car from them in ************* and traded my Kia ******** 2018 for their 2020 venue. The steering started to pull left and right when I was driving. I brought it to Big * Tires and had them do a maintenance check on the vehicle. They found nothing wrong with the car.  The steering is started pulling left and right so in August I brought it to Fire Stone ******** and they found the alignment to be off, so they tweeked it. The steering wheel started to pull left and right again. So Nov. 10 I brought it to ********************, the service tech ran a Carfax and saw that the car has been in a front end accident prior to me buying it. There was a missing bolt, s**** that was loose, and some thing about the strut and arm control. They also took a video of it. Neither Carvana or Silver Rock, the warranty company would pay to get the alignment fixed. They said they dont pay for accidents and alignments so I had to pay $955.95 to get the car out but car was still unsafe to drive. I asked Carvana to pay me back since this was pre-existing before I bought the car. Nope Carvana would not reimburse me but said I can swap the car out for another car and they would give me all my money back and apply it towards the new car. So I found a *************************************************************************************************** a document page with bogus fees, adding up to the amount $29,033.51.

Three days before our scheduled pick-up day, we were told we needed to send some additional documents proving our current address (a driver's license, passport, credit card bill, and property tax assessment were not proof enough, apparently) and produce a statement from our insurance company that the car was guaranteed to be covered for two months following pick-up. When we called and spoke with three different agents about this issue, no on knew what were were talking about. Just by chance, we discovered the next day that our pick-up had been cancelled.

For example, my car had a leaking roof because the window had pulled away from the top (convertible). I didn't realize until it rained that this was an issue and by then the warranty had expired.

The car started to stall while I was driving, I tried my best to pull it over, once that was happened the car completely shut off, all the lights on the dash board came on, and oh! it started smoking.

I checked daily for an update. Come Oct 24 I decided to call them because no status was changed to verify, nothing ever updated. After calling them I come to find out- no one even looked at my paperwork- so now my pick up was delayed a day to Oct 26 because no one at Carvana looked at my application after sending it in. They made me go print some paperwork out- when prior everything was signed through app. We arrive Oct 26- to find no cars in the vending machine. It was broken. They told me I could still throw coin in but didnt get to have that cool experience they talk about on commercials- but whatever right? Im getting my dream car- got the car keys LESS GO! Before leaving ************* what the person who helped us there told us she recommended that car be looked over by **** or one of their approved shops- since I have 7 day to decide if I wanna keep the car. She said the list of approved places were in all the documents she handed me- THEY WERENT. We drove car off lot and right away we heard a weird noise going into 6th gear. Automatic red flag. We drove it all the way home and kept happening. Carvana claims they inspect their cars BUT obviously they dont because  I should have never been sold the car like that. Right away, I email *** and ask her to send me the list and she never did. So I go to a **** dealership- and pay $204 dollars that I later came to find out if she HAD DONE HER JOB I could have gone to a shop closer to my house and not pay! So as **** told me- call Carvana so I can get the warranty approve on whatever I had to go to get car fixed. They now send me a list of approved places- take it to them- they diagnosis the same thing I paid $204 forbeen a week now and only reason Im keeping the car is because its hard to find this car and the miles on it- basically new- and as Carvana stated- you keep the car and it will get fixed-",no response,No response

The first is a 2013 AUDI Q5 beautiful vehicle. 2nd day I had it, all the dash lights came on, so I returned it. A few weeks passed, and I thought I would try again; I found a beautiful *** X3 with low miles; I took ownership of it, and thank god I purchased that extended warranty because not even six months into it, it had a significant problem that cost over $6,000, six months later the engine was dead at less than ****** miles. So I thought, well, I need another car. Let's try this again. CARVANA has been looking for the vehicle I chose for the past 3.5 months; then they said it was ready for delivery; four times the schedule was set, they decided the times, not me, no phone call, text, not anything other than one time they emailed and not coming today my apt was for 2:30 pm, the email was received at 4:37 pm. Then I asked if I could pick it up easier to swap cars; however, I had forgotten I didn't have a tag. It expired two weeks after I received the one I was swapping out.

I then had to call Silver rock (their company that deals with repair claims) and ask them how to obtain a rental car and they verified they reimburse after the fact for $40/day and any other costs like Lyft or Uber costs. My car was at Mini ****** and they contacted Silver rock to start the process of getting this key fob issue fixed. As the dealership looked and did full diagnostics, not only was the key fob an aftermarket fob that did a full reset of the starting system, but they also found about $5000 worth of mechanical issues wrong with the car and advised me that there was NO WAY the 150 point maintenance check that Carvana claims to do would not have seen these things. So they sold me a car knowing it had mechanical issues, which is so disheartening. I then submitted my reimbursement claim for the car rental and Lyft rides I had to pay for ($175) and checked status today only to find out that they dont have any record of a claim and I dont get my money back.

However, the customer experience since then has been very poor. We had two minor issues with the vehicle that their own delivery person noted and said he would create a report so that the issues would be taken care of. The vehicle was missing front passenger and driver floor mats and missing a front bracket license plate holder (required in **). Both of these issues were promised at delivery to be taken care of. However, upon further follow up when no bracket or floor mats arrived in the mail we called (after the 7 day window), they didn't see it in the system and since it was past the 7 days they refused to fix these two errors. However, logically if we were told the items would arrive in the mail it is reasonable for us to have waited longer than 7 days for processing and shipment of the mats and bracket.These are minor costs that they could have easily spent $100-$150 or so to create a loyal fan and a customer who would return. Instead they decided to create a one-time customer never to return.  The cost isn't the problem in my mind, it's the customer service. Such a shame. They have such a great app but their lack of care for the customer after the purchase is very poor.",no response,No response

I once again have to reach out to them to know where I stand during this process of them getting the check and the delivery.

I submitted all the information on time and the last thing I had to do was wait for my delivery day. I was told to expect a phone call from the person who will be delivering the car before my delivery time. I waited hours for this call and never received one. Five minutes before my delivery time I decided to call Carvana customer service. I opted for the call back since I was on hold for a while and twenty minutes later I got a call and asked them if my car was still coming or if there was a delay I was not aware of. The underwriter told me that the car purchase was no longer in my profile and not under my name. He told me that they tried to call the credit union to verify the check but could not (side note: I work at this credit union and we always verify checks). I was told the Carvana system contacted me via phone and email about this. I had no missed calls, no voicemails, and no emails, despite me verifying my contact information. So, since I was not made aware of this issue and never rescheduled my delivery date, they cancelled my order and sent the car back to where it was originally being held. Since it was in transport when I called, they could not do anything to remedy this situation. The only thing I could do was wait for the car to become available again and then redo the purchase. I was told it would only take a couple days for the car to become available. A week later, the car is still not available for purchase and I gave up on it. This was super heartbreaking for me because this has been my dream car since I was 5 and the price on Carvana was such a good deal.

We are currently awaiting pickup of the car we purchased. I can only hope there is no hassle with the refund.We purchased a white 2012 ***** Civic coupe with under ****** miles.

There were at least three deep scratches in the paint.Carvana's warranty department agreed to work on one scratch and replace the air filter, but nothing else. Hours of discussion with personnel at Carvana and their warranty department led to nothing but refusal.This was all within the seven day return period, so hopefully the refund will be prompt.

I likewise had the carvanacare premier plan. I purchased the vehicle a month ago.They denied my claim for a tire rotation and wheel balance. The repair shop wanted to do a wheel balance to see if it would fix the vibrations at high speeds. SilverRock claimed that was maintenance and would not pay the claim although I just purchased the car and it was not routine maintenance.  When I explained that all my maintenance was supposed to be covered for the first year or first ****** miles, they told me it doesn't cover that type of maintenance. The problem was caused when Carvana put new tires on before I purchased the vehicle. The tires we're installed improperly but they stuck me with the ****, although they claim you have a 100-day warranty. Furthermore, Carvana advertised their carvancare premier coverage as a bumper to bumper warranty. They fix dings, dents, and tires but the rotations that are needed due to the tires being out of alignment are not covered. Lastly, there is car paint misted all over the windshield and over the front headlights. It's clear there was some sort of repair done because upon careful inspection small blotches of paint are on different parts around the car. It's, obvious a new window had been installed as well because of the paint chipping around the windshield. This is suspicious because the car was suppose to have had no accidents reported.Unfortunately, I did not notice until after the 7 days. I believed them when they said I had 100 days to report and issue and they would fix it.

I purchased a car through Carvana, and then decided to swap it for a different one after a few days.  I called Carvana and spoke with a representative who confirmed I called within the 7-day return policy.  I chose another car and the rep started the swap process.  I drove the 2 hours to the hub to swap the first vehicle for the second one but was told by the local agent that someone at Carvana did not check the correct boxes and the swap could not happen.

On the day of delivery, I received a text message that there was an issue with the vehicle (dead battery and trunk would not open). We rescheduled for a week later. Again, on day of delivery, they texted me to tell me the problem wasn't resolved. I rescheduled for a fourth time and gave explicit instructions to contact me during the week to give a status update. After they failed to do this, I called and requested an update. I was left a voice-mail ensuring me the car was finally ready.

After a number of delivery delays (3 i believe), the car was finally delivered.  The driver was ******* to drop it off.  I looked and lo, they damaged the front bumper during the delivery (looked like the vehicle was not properly secured on the flatbed). Needless to say i rejected the delivery and requested a repair.  About a month later the deliver was reattempted.   The repair job on the bumper was poor - debris under the paint and bubbling paint all over.  I rejected the delivery and asked them ti fix.  Another mon goes by and they finally attempt to redeliver the car - this time with new damage - the leather on the inside has cracked open and began to peel, probably d Fast forward 6 months or so.   I had negotiated a substantial refund due to poor service with the previous vehicle.   I place an order for a low mileage porsche  911 which passed all Carvana inspections.   After a couple of delays (took a few months, mind you) i got through to Carvana to find out the the car has engine trouble and has been towed to the Porsche dealer for repair.  (How did it pass the famed Carvana 150 point inspection?).   I cancelled that transaction.   I came back to Carvana the third time (what can i say, negotiated refun was nice and guess i am a glutton for punishment) and ordered another ********* took the car about 3 months to go through the inspection and photo process.  I patiently waited.   The delivery was scheduled and i had numerous assurances that the vehicle will be delivered on time.  It never arrived.  Why?

They place unreasonable deadlines on submitting documents, such as requiring my bank to submit a document on a Sunday. They also are knowingly falsely advertising because the representative told me on the phone that there must be a minimum number of days between receiving the money for the car and the delivery. Also, they did not deliver the vehicle as promised.  We waited around all day on Saturday for our vehicle to be delivered, they were late, and when they arrived they ended up taking the vehicle back because they couldnt find the check which had been mailed to them four days prior. They forced me to insure the vehicle before I even touched it. The vehicle also came incredibly dirty - there was gum stuck to the seats, dirt all over, and candy wrappers in the back.

My car insurance company had to go out of their way to move my policy around to make it work.  It was LOTS of trouble for me and my insurance company.  I went to pick my new car up, which is what I opted to do versus having it delivered, and I made a mistake on the appointment the first go round, I thought it was 10:30am, but apparently it was 10:00am, so I had to be rescheduled for the next day after work.  I arrived again to get my car, and the guy in front of me was buying a $50,000 ish ****  I seen the automatic car stall out when driving it out of the vending machine.  He looked it over, came back in and declined it.  Had front end damage that wasnt disclosed. And something under the front bumper being held together with a zip tie.

According to the website it was supposed to drive us happy and promised many things. When the vehicle was delivered, it was clearly not what was advertised. It was a 2015 ***** Pilot SE 4x4. Upon arrival we noted that the car pulled hard to the left, had a horribly corroded battery, shook the steering wheel tremendously when applying the brakes and had some cosmetic damage that was not reported on their vehicle description. All of these repairs and the cosmetic damage were approved to be repaired at the time of arrival. The vehicle went directly to National Tire and Battery per their contract with Silver Rock as one of their authorized repair facilities. NTB did nothing with the front brakes at our first appointment and were only instructed by SR to replace the back brake pads. We returned it the following day to have both front rotors and pads fully replaced at no charge as promised. The brake fluid was cloudy and needed to be replaced. It was denied and left as is due to a BS clause that brake fluid is normal wear and tear. We had the vehicle for three days and they still refused to cover the fluids. We had brand new brakes with filthy fluids. The issue of the hard pull to the left was diagnosed by stating NTB had done an alignment and the problem should be gone. It wasnt gone at all. I was then instructed to take it to another mechanic for further diagnosis. Long story short, we took it to multiple other mechanics per SR instruction. We wasted two more weeks of running around only to be denied the repair and told that NTB is now responsible and it should warranties by their negligence at the i trial brake job.

We called to inquire about obtaining a new one and they told us that the vehicle was registered and a package was allegedly delivered to us with no signature required so nothing they can do.

Thought the issue was probably a fluke.  In this case, the car is fine but really nothing else.A few days prior to the delivery Carvana required a conference call with our bank to verify funds.  No problem, plenty of cash to cover the cost of the car.  The first problem came when payment was to be made, Carvana claimed that they could not get a transfer for the purchase price because our account was overdrawn.  I looked at our account online and there was still plenty of cash to cover the purchase.  Carvana then said that they couldn't, or wouldn't, try again and that we either had to send a cashier's check overnight at our expense or do a wire transfer again at our expense.  We chose to do the wire transfer and emailed copies of the transaction as requested.  The car was delivered just fine, but a few days later I started getting calls and emails from Carvana stating that we still had to pay for the car.  I would explain that we did, in fact, already pay for the car and would send them copies of the wire transfer.  This continued for almost two weeks.When we purchased the car, we chose the option that we would pay extra at the time of the sale, and in return Carvana would take care of the taxes, fees, etc., and have the plates sent to us.  On June 10th I received an email from Carvana stating your registration is complete and your plates are on the way via ***** and should arrive in 5-7 business days.Approximately 10 business days later and we have no plates.  So I reached out to Carvana and was told, sorry, that's an automated email your plates were actually sent by **** and should arrive in ***** business days.  Don't worry everything has been taken care of.So I wait.  On July 5th, I still have no plates so I call Carvana again.  This time I am told that",no response,No response

The issue started when my paper tags expired. There is currently a three month wait for registration in my state. The paper tags I was given expired in a month so like I would with a normal dealership I called 10 days in advance to ensure there were no issues. I was told with in **** days I would have new tags. Here we are 23 days later and no tags. Even worse is that they did not even begin processing my request until the 7 days after I called. After much back and forth and several phone calls I discover that since it was never processed now my vehicle is inoperable because there is no registration. The most frustrating part is that they are taking no accountability. They are blaming my state even though this is clearly their error. I purchased my car for work and had several colleagues do the same and though. They have no issues with getting their paper tags in a timely manner. I seriously regret not just buying from a standard dealer.

They are overpriced compared to everywhere else.  I told myself that their free 90 day, ***** (I cant remember the exact mileage actually) miles warranty was worth the extra price.    Its not.  First they delayed my delivery 2 different times, on the morning I was supposed to receive my Mustang.  Then when I finally did receive my Mustang they didnt disclose that the exhaust was not stock and my car actually sounded like a rocket engine.  It was cool for 1 minute.  The exhaust gave me a headache and was not installed properly and there was rust on the bottom of the car.  My mechanic said he wouldnt touch the car with a 10 foot pole.  Another positive is Carvana has a 7 day return policy.  I returned the car within 3 days and they sent someone to pick it up (who didnt drive stick) so I had to drive the car up onto the truck.  I was promised Id receive my cash down payment as soon as they took possession of my retuned vehicle.  I called today (two weeks later and they didnt even process the payment yet).  Yes they took the money out via ACH as soon as I got my car delivered.  They were very quick when they wanted my money but took 3 plus weeks giving me my money back.  On top of that the money they owed me for buying my car was paid via check and also took 3 plus weeks to get to me.

Without a doubt, this is the most trouble I have ever had buying a car. Some highlights of what went down:1) when the (black) car was delivered it was covered in white marks that were either some kind of paint rash, overspray, or something of the kind (not an expert so couldn't say exactly what it was). The Carvana rep who delivered it suggested that I accept it and call Carvana to see if the issues could just be fixed. Since at the time I was going through the death of a close family member I decided to take that chance and not try to find another car right then.2) shortly afterward I was notified by Carvana that they had messed up the paperwork for the car inspection report and they needed me to go in and have a second inspection done and mail them the paperwork.3) I continually received conflicting information about how they wanted that report sent back to them (online, mail, etc)4) I was repeatedly told they were sending me urgent paperwork for signature which never arrived and they now say not to worry about it 5) in order to fix the cosmetic issues on the car (which were essentially the same problem all over) they made me submit a specific request for every single panel on the car. Go to a normal dealer and see that the car you want has obvious issues it's as simple as writing into the contract that such-and-such will be fixed. Carvana has a new way to handle it: ""prove it. Then we will consider fixing it. But only if we feel like it.""6) The cosmetic problem that I felt was most important (a paint chip which I am worried about rusting/spreading) is something they have deemed (within our standards for quality).

I have been on the phone Every day with them for 30 minutes for the last two weeks and we are nowhere closer to getting my required paperwork to drive legally and show proof of ownership besides the Carvana contract.

When the car was delivered there were countless damages from all 4 wheels/rims being damaged, 2 cracks in the windshield and a broken windshield wiper.

Come to find out they charged me $990!!!! Crazy nuts! Besides the fact they had me waiting for all these months! I WILL NEVER BUY A VEHICLE FROM THEM AGAIN! It is true after I did some research, that if you are not in their ""local"" delivery area, you have a 3rd party delivering your card when they get good and ready.

One had such a bar and clear repainting and damage from being in an accident, one had parts of the front fender hanging. I ended up transferred to their ""executive resolution"" team, which is a joke. They're just a puppet that does nothing for you that just handles customers they're s******* over.My main issue is I purchased an initial vehicle which I didn't like, returned and swapped for another, which was the one in an accident and poorly repainted. Couldn't tell from the pictures. Returned that vehicle and wanted to add my trade, so they said let's just start a whole new transaction, return the car, then place a new order to add the trade. I obliged and they took their vehicle back, refunded my deposit, and we started new transaction.This time I purchased a newer vehicle and added my trade and paid the down payment. If you're keeping count, that's 3 total vehicles, though over two separate transactions/sales. This new vehicle has aftermarket changes that I wasn't happy with and make me nervous to keep for long term reliability. I notate this to my executive resolution rep and mention I'll take it to get looked at, but likely want to swap. I'm told I don't get another swap, even though their site and my contract clearly state you can order a vehicle and swap it for another one up to 3 times, but on the 3rd time you don't get the 7 day return guarantee. I said this and was still denied. So they breached contract guarantees. As well, when I asked for my trade back then, I followed it in the Jaguar Remote app that tracks trips etc, and they driving it, taking it home, out to pick their kids up, and to a bar, and allowing it to be kept at an employees house overnight. Their reasoning was ""to empty the tank"". But I gave it to them on empty, so they lied to cover their butts. Overall a horrible company that cheats customers.",no response,No response

He said he was unable to print the temporary plates because he was never given a log in for that and everyone who could had left early for the day.

Last week the vehicle sound had appeared louder.  This week even louder.

Silver Rock warranty (which covers the car ***** mi or 4 mos.)  was a part of your purchasing agreement as an enhancement to the Carvana car buying experience  Silver Rock Warranty asked the manager at Tires Plus to send a picture of what looked like a dented resonator muffler.  So he did.  Silver Rock denied the claim.  I called Silver Rock and was told it was denied because I did it.  The rep further stated the manager over at Tires Plus stated the same thing.  I went back to Tires Plus to confront the manager.  Manager  was a bit angry because he never stated that to Silver Rock.  He stated the exhaust was damaged of impact.   After going on and on with Silver R. warranty reps (you never get the same one), notes were added to my case.  This is the same way at Carvana.   I spoke with ******* from Carvana.  She encouraged me to get a second opinion.  If Silver R. would deny the claim again, call back Carvana and they can get this hashed out with a possible over ride (she said in so many words).  So I did.  I had to go to an non-preferred place because Tires Plus couldnt get the part even IF Silver R. honored the claim.  I went to a shop  today.  The manager had the car on the rack and stated to me there was no way this was a current dent.  There is rust.  He said it was old.  He further stated that the resonator is crushing the enveloping inside making the sound get worse and worse.  Manager there called Silver rock.  The place denied the claim.

Finally a week ago out someone told us the vehicle was coming from *******. At one point they lied and said it was delayed because they had to check the battery and charge the vehicle (2015 *** i3). All ""Carvana Certified"" vehicles are listed on the website, so why need to check the most integral part of an electric car after we've begun the purchase? We financed with a local bank. The retail purchase agreement had some wrong information listed and our loan officer wouldn't cut the check until they fixed this. We were on a call with an ""advocate"" for 4 hours. They had to repeatedly attempt to fix the document. Each time they sent the ""fixed"" RPA it was still incorrect. Our pickup day finally arrived. We live 3.5 hours away from the ********** Vending Machine and chose to pickup rather than home delivery because initially it was a way to get the vehicle sooner and the experience seemed fun. Once we were 30 minutes away and before our scheduled pickup, we got a call that they had lost BOTH remote keys to our vehicle on the way back from the car wash. Once we arrived there, we were immediately greeted by a ""Senior Advocate"" named ***** who didn't even let us get out of the parking lot before telling us driving the vehicle away that day would be impossible.

My current monthly payment is about $400 per month for the 2019 Kia ******* and they would sell my car for likely more than $25 based on similar listings but want to cheat me out of a decent trade. What's worse is that you can't seem to purge your personal information from their site and this is a huge issue since they collect so much information about you.

It is Friday.....no check. We called & were told it was probably sent to the central office & would need to be arrive there before they could get it back to us. Basically getting the runaround.

They claimed there was warranty issues with Infiniti and blamed Infiniti. I then called Infiniti and they stated there were no recalls on my car. I then continued to CALL THEM not the other way around to consistently confirm the car would make the new date. I was informed during one of my calls ""oh wait.. they got it back and now they are painting it"".. I am sorry but WHAT? Yup... got delayed again.

1417,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,06/01/2022,Worst idea ever. Seemed easy enough to go online find vehicle and setup purchase on 5/18/2022. We provide everything they required including the financed payment for the vehicle. Set to deliver 5/24/2022. They contact us day before to advise there will be delay and I would receive the vehicle on 5/29/2022. Though inconvenient we can work with date. Then at the close of business right before the delivery on 5/29 we receive notification now it is being pushed back to 6/13. When inquiring why they advise the literally lost the keys to our car. Irritated I asked to just purchase new vehicle since timeframe does not fit what we needed. We find another vehicle same day 5/27 at the close of business day (bank closed due to holiday through 5/31). So they advise that I have to have bank send check by 5/31. Mind you we are talking late on a holiday Friday and they expect bank to have done on a national holiday. When I pointed out how absurd this was they changed the date to 6/1 and I was advised I had until 2 pm. After my loan officer with bank doing the impossible getting this all financed within a business day at 1:14pm I go to upload check and they CHANGED the date again saying I didn't submit check on time. I call to ask why and I am advised I was given the wrong time from different time zone. Did they take accountability? NOPE. They proceed to blame me for not submitting on time and proceed to push back delivery date ANOTHER week. By far the worst experience I have ever received in my life. No compensation no real accountability for mistakes. Instead they have reps who call you and blame YOU for THEIR mistakes. It was the most insane purchase experience anywhere. Carvana is awful and their left hand has no idea what the right hand it doing. What is worse they are willing to lie or say ANYTHING to get you off phone.

Door seals leaked, windshield leaked, trunk seals leaked, and you could tell where the car had been previously wrecked. Carvana said they were going to ""swap it out"" for a similar car that we chose...  However, what they actually ended up doing was canceling the original loan, re-running my credit four more times, then using their loan and their inquiries to change my loan terms. Suddenly a $21k loan goes from $0 down, $320 a month to $3k down $550 a month. Ultimately I was out my original car which ran fine but I sold before I knew how horrible Carvana is as a company. Two months of insurance cost for a car I couldn't drive ($530.00) because it was growing black mold from rain damage. A TON of lost time (nearly 30 hours) on the phone dealing with thier ""customer support"" and ""customer advocates"". The embarrassment of having to bumming rides, etc. from family.  A rental car for nearly a month while I was looking for another car ($3000.00). This doesn't even include damage to my credit from Carvana running it so many times, and putting their original loan on it (which they have refused to remove). What ever you do, DO NOT PURCHASE FROM CARVANA, there is a reason they HAD to lay off **** workers, and it is because they are a horrible company who abuses the consumer. Not only that they recently terminated **** employees in a Zoom meeting so they are also apparently a horrible place to work. As far as addressing my concerns, ultimately I was told to refer to their legal department. (Basically telling me the only way to get the money back that THEIR negligence caused was to *** them.

Also, pay very close attention to the list of ""Installed Options"" or ""Installed Packages"" and make sure you get everything that was listed in the description.I purchased the car that I loved and had no plans of returning it, even though the delivery driver offered to me after she pulled the car into my driveway a detailing credit because she was not happy with the way the car was left for her to deliver...there were coin marks in the cup holders, dust on the dash and crumbs on the seats.....not to mention she also pointed out there were no floor mats in the care so she added the useless pieces of paper to the font floors.Then within a few weeks of owning the car, it needed a new crankshaft pully (it's so off balance it threw both accessory belts), the timing belt cover (the crankshaft pully wore a hole in it) and a new steering rack (it leaked out all the fluid).  Luckily I bought the extended warranty, but if I hadn't I'd be on the hook for over $2k in repairs at around 2 months of ownership. These are things that should have been caught in the '150 point inspection' and weren't.In the original listing, it showed the car would come with ""floor mats w/ STi logo"", wheel lock kit, cargo tray and bumper applique (fancy plastic cover to protect the top of the back bumper by the trunk).....I could have done better at keeping them honest sooner, but when I did reach out to them they said they had done what they needed to do by issuing me a $170 check to cover the detailing and floor mats.....end of discussion.

Fast forward to a few weeks later, I took my car to the body shop to get fixed since it was approved for it.The body shop then tells me that silver rock and Carvana only approved one scratch! 1! Out of 13 pictures and damages they only approved one scratch. When I called Carvana to find out what had happened the agent told me that Carvana and silver rock determined that the damage they will cover was only 1 scratch and the rest meets their standard for a used car. I told the woman that its not fair to deliver a car that you didnt disclose the damages of. I asked her if she knew that Carvana didnt disclose the damages, she said yes that is correct but that Carvana would still not honor their promise to fix it. I asked their legal team information and she gave me that, a few hours later she called back and profusely apologized and swore up and down that she would get it taken care of herself, apologized in the way I was treated and that she understands how frustrating it must be. She really played her part in that one, its been a week. I havent heard anything from silver rock or Carvana so I decided to check in and to my surprise the woman that was helping me is no longer available to help and the person who I was on the phone with all of a sudden turned into management team and said sorry but we arent going to approve that because of standards.

From the start everything is smooth and straight forward. You can sell your car or buy a used one. I will admit they made it very easy to trade my vehicle in. Filled out my info and was able to bring it in and get my vehicle. They make you feel special which was awesome. The coin drop and car vending machine is so cool. That exciting gets ruined by the back end of stuff. Registration started with a small hiccup. They started a process for new registration even though I wanted to use my existing plates. I asked them how much the new tags would be and they said it would cost $300. I said I'd rather have my existing plates and they said no problem but also stated  that they couldn't change it because it was already being process and would change mess up the finance rate and I wouldn't be able to drive off with my new vehicle that day. When we finalized the process they would get everything taken care of and would refund me the FULL $300. Everything was fine until I noticed the registration was completed and I was informed that I was getting my new plates which wasn't supposed to be a thing. I called they said sorry we dropped the ball you are getting new plates you can replaces them with the old ones. I decided to go that route because they were ""on the way"" and he offered me $100 for inconvenience. I accepted and waited another 3 weeks to no new plates. I called carvana again and was instructed to call my DMV. So thats what I did. That was when I found out that my old tags have been registered this hole time and there has been no process for new ones. I was like Carvana ***** but whatever I'll just get that refund I requested earlier. When I reached out the last time I was told that I couldn't have a full refund that they could only offer me $100 for bad experience. I purchased in IL which tells you all you need to know.

At first things went fine with the online process of purchasing a car and getting a quote and trade for our other car. Then as things progress thats when the problem started. For our very first delivery the driver was almost 3 hours late. There was a clerical error on their end which caused a hiccup in our delivery process. We were able to get that resolved after some tension and some paperwork. The next day the remotes to the car that we purchased only worked every now and again . And then two days after that the console in the front of the car where theres the sunglass case and the overhead lightsfell from the roof. That was the final straw. We realized this was cursed. We called on day three to activate our return and get our old car back.  We called on a Sunday they scheduled the delivery for Wednesday. Wednesday has come and gone as they never actually scheduled our return to begin with. The communication since we initiated our return has been completely inadequate. I have called am every single day since and every time Ive called they are never on the same page.  So now not only are we stuck with a defective car for another few days but I have zero faith in this company that I will actually get my own car back as they promised.

You provide them with the documentation they need and once you are approved...you wait.  You wait for delivery.  Then, you wait for delivery.  Then your delivery is cancelled and then rescheduled...without your input I might add.  Then you still have the option to reschedule to a more convenient time.  Then, if any changes...no matter how minute are made, you sign contracts.  This serves to push out your delivery even further.  Then finally, the big date of the delivery arrives and no delivery.  They never even showed up.  There was no phone call, no text, no e-mail, and most importantly no vehicle delivered.  I called to find out where my much anticipated vehicle was and why it wasn't delivered.  The Carvana Advocate had no idea.  Seriously, they had no idea.  In fact, they kept telling me everything was a go and that my vehicle was on the way.  I would wager that when you run a business where vehicle delivery is your main staple that logistics should be paramount.  They obviously are not at Carvana.  If you want another car maybe use Carvana.   If you need another car, I absolutely would say don't.  When you don't have a vehicle, time is of the essense.  They can't stick to schedules and give you the run around and excuses. I cancelled my order after 2 delays and a failed delivery.

Both passenger doors as well as the front bumper. Carvana and their warranty arm ""Silverrock"" just kept bouncing the ball back and forth and no one would tell me or the auto shop how much they would or would not repair. Lucky for me I have experience buying cars, so I kept pushing out the 7 day money back guarantee date (twice) until it got to the point where they actually told my auto shop to resend the 2 quotes as 1 quote and then they would re-review it. Obvious they thought they would get me to bite and the money back date would expire. At that point I contacted Carvana and told them I was returning the car. There is a reason Carvana photos are not the greatest as they don't want you to zoom in to see all the flaws in the paint, etc. At the end of the day I'd hate to see someone who doesn't know as much about cars get hoodwinked by Carvana and pay $5K to 10K more for a car than they should.",no response,No response

I wasnt sure why they sent me that email?I still had the delivery day and was excited to get the car. The day came and the car was delayed and I was given a different day. Ok I can deal with that. The next day came and went. Another delay. Finally the next day came. I spoke with carvana everything was set to go. I made sure it was ready because the car was coming the next day and when we got the car we were driving to Michigan in the new car for Mothers Day. I couldnt sleep that night I was excited. At 1:30 am the day of delivery I get an email delayed once again for 9 days more. I cancelled my insurance on my current car to get insurance for my new car. Now I have no car and no insurance.

I figured it would be an easy fix (alignment) so I wasn't too worried.  I brought it up to the representative who dropped it off and he said contact Silver Rock. I got the vehicle inspected and they immediately told me to return it. They said it was not safe to drive (after I drove me family with two kids in it).

1472,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,05/03/2022,Think hard before buying a car you've never seen or drove. They give you a 7 day trial but before you get to even look in the car you have to purchase insurance. They won't let you see the inside or take it off the truck until you paid for insurance. My car can late Saturday evening I took it for a test drive but didn't real check it out as well as I should but hey I have seven days. No one told me the would that the money out of my account the very next day. I paid cash. So it is a 7 day trial but you bought the car on day one. So Sunday I decide to take it for spin around the city....I start the car and it wasn't a guiet smooth sound. It drove fine no issues but it just didn't sound like a car I'd want to buy for *****. Then I need to back up. Backup camera is not working. It was either black or grainy you couldn't see. The touch screen did not work. You would tap on one thing and get another or you would have to tap on it until you gave up. The car was not sterilized because the driver got in the car after it was unloaded. Touch less it was not. So I returned the car. They take your money in less than 24 hours but to return it take 3-5 business day. So if that's all your money you have to wait so make sure you keep something to drive. Not sure what happens if you had a trade in. They make it so you have to get another carvana car. I find it hard to believe they do any kind of inspection on these cars. My car was unexceptionable for a sale. I was insulted they brought me car that they thought I'd buy or buy them go have it fixed.....trying to talk to someone is almost impossible. You have to text and the agent told me she as multiple people she's helping. 13 min between each reply. Took almost an hour to to get 4 guestions answered......

So I called and they told me they hadn't even finished the inspection so my car was finally delivered 3 weeks after the scheduled day. Then my paperwork was mailed to me and it was wrong so I had to call and request them to fix and resend all my documents. They did and I sent it all back. Over a month later they were still saying they never got my papers. I called and asked them for new registration paperwork so I could send it in. They told me to give it a week and call again if they didn't get my paperwork. So I was supposed to call them if they didn't get my paperwork. It seems like the didn't. I made 4 payments on my car when they redid my whole contract. They messed up my loan and made it look like I was over due by all of my payments. It took them about a week and constant pestering for them to fix it. Once that was fixed they took 2 payments when I only authorized 1. Do not buy from this company.

You could always pay the delivery fee, but if you want to trade your vehicle that won't work because they won't pick yours ** in the process since they use a third party. If you don't get a call back in the time-frame they give you to complete documents because of an error on their end, they will just cancel your order if not completed and then up the price of the vehicle so you have to pay more for it if you re-order (this is also something that can be done if you have already secured a loan through your bank). Then you have to figure out how to add that to a loan or pay out of pocket. If you drive to a pickup location and go the night before due to weather to insure you are there at the time of delivery, they can still not deliver it to you. They will give you excuse after excuse and not make it right and still make you reschedule and spend the gas and hotel money again if there is a need to reschedule.

The day before we were to exchange, we saw on the app that our loan information had not gone through (even though several representatives had confirmed that it had). Needless to say, we lost our time slot, and spent another 3 hours on the phone with Carvana trying to figure out the problems with transferring the loan to the exchange vehicle. Its been 3 weeks and we STILL have not been able to work it out to get out exchange vehicle. This company needs to streamline their 3rd party lender process and exchange process.

From misfiling paperwork, to selling a car we were purchasing without letting us know, to cancelling our appointment multiple times I do not recommend buying from this company. Not only are you required to sign paper after paper, but you need to make sure that the car you are actually buying is the car that is ACTUALLY LISTED and that the *** numbers match. We chose a car with all of the perks we were looking for, just to get the car delivered without ANY of them because the listing was wrong. The agent told us the app is inaccurate and to rely on the website, we then compared our notes on both the *** and the WEBSITE and they were BOTH incorrect. You will not get exactly what is listed in the features they just write them to sell the car quicker, ex: no heated seats or AWD. When asked for a different car they told us that there was nothing they could do for us so we were stuck as we had a trade in that is now long gone. Please be careful using this company. It may seem easier than a dealer in the long run but they were definitely quick to take my money without handling the rest of the transaction very well and now we are stuck with a car that does not have any of the amenities we thought we were getting.",no response,No response

There are days because of the **** For this reason, I will provide you with a 2nd TOP no worries,  after 20 days with the 2nd TOP I called them to see what was the status of my registration and they asked for an Address Validation I uploaded my Driver's license and one pay stop.

I have been calling every day for the last 5 days to get this resolved because today is my last day to use the car since my TOP will be not valid after 3.24.22 and I cannot even reach a supervisor. They denied talking with me because they are busy. The solution for them is to send me a check for $250 every week for up to 6 weeks to cover my stress. I told them I cannot rent a car for a week with that money, I requested to get at less the full cover of the expenses for this mistake that is on your side, not mine, but they told me they can do no more for me. Now, I cannot drive my car for who knows how long. My guarantee probably will be expired by the time I can drive the car again (I have only 47 days left).

I chose to finance through a 3rd party because I could get a 2% interest rate and the best Carvana offer was 12%. There were some extra stresses financing 3rd party but I felt like they were understandable.  Like many others, I experienced several delays with delivery but when it finally arrived, the delivery driver was wonderful.  That experience was the best part of the process.  But beware after the purchase!  For the last 3 weeks, it has been nothing but issues.  For some reason, Carvana wants to register the vehicle for you.  So, you should send them the assessment and tax recipient.  But when you request paperwork to complete the assessment, they will not send it to you!  After a lengthy meeting with the county assessor to work around Caravanas lack of cooperation, I was able to send them a new assume that and tax receipt.  The very next day, Carvana contacts me and states that they are unable to complete the registration of my vehicle because my current insurance card expires in less than 60 days.  I contact my insurance company and no surprise, they arent able to give me a new card with different dates.  So I contact Carvana and explain thats not possible.  They admit that my state doesnt require this extended insurance and that just a current proof of insurance would do but they have an internal policy because they work with other states and refuse to register my vehicle.  They advised that I could wait two months until I received the new insurance card and they would register then.  Obviously, I need to drive the car so thats not an option!  So I ask them to send me back my money for the vehicles sales tax and paperwork so I can register it myself.  Now they are refusing to send it to me unless I send them written permission from the lender that states its okay for me to register the car!I would NOT recommend this process!",no response,No response

1569,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,03/17/2022,"Me and my husband were initially so excited to buy a car from carvana because we found the car we were looking for and fit all the criterea and never had to leave our home. We read mixed reviewed on other people's experience, but decided that the bad experiences usually are the ones posted and we were sure that there had to be more better experiences out there. Well then fast forward to our current experience. We bought out car the last week of february. We were hurried along to provide our payment information to them and at that time we had a delivery date of 3/4/22. When we were not able to get the payment info to them within just a 12 hour window, our delivery was pushed back to 3/9/22. as we approached the 3/9/22 date, my husband received a texted stating that the delivery was rescheduled again to 3/15/22. They said that this was due to road constraints and transportation issues. I asked the rep i spoke with and they said that the car had not even left the ******** facility it was originally at. Then on monday of this week we received another message stating that our car would be rescheduled again to 3/22/22. We have spoken to an ""escalation agent"" and they have told us that the car is in indiana but now the car is not scheduled to leave Indiana until 9pm on 3/21/22. Which means we probably will not receive our vehicle on 3/22/22 as well. We just want the car that we have given our payment for. How is it fair for us to be rushed to provide payment for a car and then not able to receive a car in a timely manner and be jerked around with the same responses each time that are ""i apologize, there is nothing we can do at this time"" and ""we are doing everything we can do get you your vehicle"" and my favorite ""we do not anticipate anymore delays"".

If I could give this company negative 5 stars, I most certainly would. This company takes full advantage of those who need a car, and scams them out of their time, if not money. They will give you an option for a ""delivery"" date, but they will keep changing it. To anyone who needs a car: don't ever go with this company, you will never get a car from them. Anyone who still wants to go with this company, should seek out the negative reviews, as they are probably the only honest reviews.

Carvana did not understand that my bank was doing an internal pay-off for my last car, so they insisted that the bank provided the wrong amount. It took several phone calls back and forth, a lot of passing the buck, and confusion to finally get Carvana to accept the 'very typical and widely understood way' my bank was providing payment. NEXT, when I get the car it is beautiful but immediately has issues. I used the warranty service and it turned out the car needed over $3000 dollars worth of work. The car shop was paid incorrectly 3 times and I could not pick up my car until the car shop was paid in full. After several calls,the warranty service finally pays the right amount and I get my car back. THEN, after CLEARLY STATING I want to transfer tags rather than get new ones...I get several updates about registration and new tags coming along well. I called about 5 times, texted, and chatted that I do not want new tags because I have tags..... I was always reassured that they were doing a transfer and not new tags. So, what do I getting the mail but new tags ??... I call carvana and tell them I got new tags and I already have tags on my car. The lady tells me that it was on the *** part because they put in an application for a transfer of tags. I called the *** and they say no they have proof that carvana put in an application for me to get new tags ??. Now, I have to deal with the *** and Carvana has washed their hands of it.....SO MUCH FOR 'THE *** BUYING EXPERIENCE'. Through my entire process every advocate that I spoke to told me that their notes had everything right yet the departments that actually did the work kept doing everything WRONG!

I received nothing.  I called repeatedly, sent emails only to be told by CD they have no idea it could be another week, 2 or 3.  They only have the same info available to them.  They highly recommended I look at other vehicles that are available immediately, despite having nothing in the same price point with low mileage and similar options.  I found one at a higher price point and reached out again to CS who said it would be in my best interests if I needed a car in the next 2 weeks. It was not even 1 day after I started the process of buying a more expensive vehicle that the one I had a deposit on suddenly went from vehicle inspection process to purchase in progress.  So for 3 weeks not one stitch up updates they could provide, at their recommendation, I forfeited the one I placed a deposit on (because they refuse to expedite refurbishment for serious buyers) and suddenly within a few hours of me starting the purchase on a different vehicle, it was available for purchase?? Such a scam.  Then they make it out to basically be my fault for my lack of patience.  3 weeks of having a deposit with NOT ONE tidbit of information or updates on the progress is just poor business practice and gives the impression of scamming people.  There is no reason why a customer cannot be provided real time updates on a car they placed deposit on and wanted to buy.  I ended up with an upgraded model vehicle but further out of my price point so I could buy NOW not wait another 3 to 4 weeks.  It seems only the lower priced vehicles are in the pre order phase making it difficult by having to wait weeks if not a month for said vehicle.

I drove to the vending machine, put the coin in, and down came a gorgeous black on black Jeep Cherokee. It was so amazing.I test drove the car and it told me the engine was hot. I heard some bad wheel bearing noise, and some other noise. We checked the coolant and it was slightly low. I purchased the car anyway, and said as long as it all gets fixed, without me paying for it, it'll be okay. I signed some papers, and I was good to go. The Carvana associate put in a vehicle repair request and I left.Days 1-3: I took it to a shop near me to get the car looked over. They said it needed some coolant hose connectors (which are on backorder). As for the noise I was hearing- there was a bad wheel bearing that they replaced for **** was still having an odd noise while I was driving so I took it back to the shop. They looked at it, come to find out it needs a driveshaft. I was taking a look at it one day, and noticed the paint had a weird sheen on the drivers door and fender. None of the gaps are the same, and nothing lines up. The car has clearly been hit and someone ""attempted"" to repair it. Silverrock and Carvana said they will pay to get it repaited and a new fender. Thursday, (2/24/22) the driveshaft finally got fixed. Friday 2/25/22- I have hardly driven the car since it got fixed. It was driving great. Went to work, picked my friend up, went to the gym, dropped my friend off, turned left off her road.... BAM. SNAP. CRACK. Car doesn't drive right now. Shutters when accelerating.  I figured maybe the driveshaft broke again. Saturday I took it back to the shop. Sunday they called me with a diagnosis that the transfer case is busted. It busted because Carvana, or the previous owner, replaced the transfer case with a junk yard one and only put 1 out of 3 screws in it. When I turned left on Friday, that 1 s**** snapped.

1594,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,02/21/2022,"I purchased a vehicle from Carvana in December 2021 with trade in. The actual buying process was smooth, but once the purchase was complete my Carvana experience took a turn.  First about a month after purchase Carvana realized they did not place the proper information in the contract so I had to resign all documents. About two weeks after that, they realized that the odometer paperwork was incorrect and they needed me to fill out this paperwork. Next they misplaced my trade ins paperwork so I had to resubmit the registration and proof of insurance. As if all of this was not bad, they claim this was holding up registering my new vehicle. My new vehicle was coming close to having the temporary registration expire, but don't worry Carvan said they would contact me should it lapse. This was not the case. A week after expiration, I had to call Carvana to see what I needed to do. Talking to the representative I learned Carvana had not even placed the order to extend my temporary registration. Now for the kicker in all of this mess. On my trade in vehicle, I had specialized plates. I received an email stating if I wanted to transfer my plates, to fill out the attached form and respond to the email. This I did. In January I contacted Carvana since my registration was delayed to verify that they were transferring my plates. I was told by the representative that if I submitted the paperwork and did what was asked it should be done. Here we are late February of 2022, I get my plates. They are not my specialized plates so of course I contact Carvana once again and am told that my account was never marked for transfer of plates. I tell this representative what has been occurring the past two months and was told that the previous representative could have updated my account or verified the transfer request. To say the least I will never do business with Carvana again and will tell all my family and friends to do the same!",no response,No response

I thought no big deal because I had the limited warranty and 7 day trial period. By the time I got home the car smelt something was burning.

Took it home, talked to Carvana and easily got an approved trade with a delivery date of 1 week out. However 4 days before I was scheduled to exchange the car the delivery date was pushed out a month!!! Carvana offered me no other options, there was no other comparable cars I could get sooner and they wouldnt even pick up the disaster of car that I couldn't drive because it's unsafe and you can't go over 400 miles ( they're making me drive it back to the vendor in a month which is 170 miles away).

The issues began when the delivery day kept being pushed back.  After speaking with many representatives, someone told me that there was an issue with the car and they couldn't say what the issue is or when it would be delivered.  They said not to worry, the car would be locked under my account and would be shipped as soon as possible.  A few days after, I login to my account to find the car isn't there.  Upon searching the website I find that someone else has a deposit on the car that I purchased, have under contract, and have a loan out for.  Because the loan is already reporting to my credit, I am unable to finance another vehicle until this issue is resolved.  I feel the customer service number is intentionally set up in a way to avoid addressing issues with customers.  The representatives you can talk to have no information or tools to address any issues other then completing a purchase submission.  There is no way to contact a ""team leader"" directly.  After speaking with many representatives I can see that issues such as mine happen often as no one is surprised about the information I'm providing.  I was extremely concerned at the lack of professionalism from the ""team leader"".  I submitted requests with 10 different customer service representatives to have a team leader call back and was ignored for almost a week and a half.  When I finally complained enough, team leader finally called me and said ""Hello, Hello, Hello"" as if he couldn't hear me and hung up.  Around and around again for hours with the regular customer service agents to get him back on the line.  I explained the situation to him for around the 20th time and he said he would deal with it immediately and send me an email with his direct number to call him tomorrow.

Found out it was burning oil at a higher rate. It was over 3 quarts low. I called them to do a back out because it was so costly. So I have been on the phone endlessly hours and days trying to get them to even exchange cars. Finally they agreed to do the back out. I had 48 hours to look on line for a call. Over 10 days I still never heard of the process. The car was only on hold for 15 more hours if I didnt call I would have started back over. They said it was going to be a trade out. Well that was not the case I found a cheaper car ****** but they said the interest was increased now. Then if I got the protection plan it was over 500 dollars more. They increased my payment to 30 more dollars. I dont understand how if this is a trade that they had to run your credit again. Then charge you more money on your very thing.

So he was told that he needed to find the part that the transmission needed and if he couldn't find that then look for a transmission, which he did......to only be told that the warranty company(silverrock) would be providing the transmission(don't trust it one bit).

I canceled and asked for my check to be overnighted to me. Yet again another bump in the road, 2 days pass and not word on my check. I call in to see whats the status for the check. According to the 3 different customer service agents, they cant locate my check. Losing my check for the 2nd time in a single transaction. For 3 hours they couldnt find my check. After talking to 4 customer agents, 1 customer service leader, and an executive overseeing that division they finally located my check. It seems as though the logistics as well as the treasury for this company are absolutely horrible. This company markets itself as being headache free and dont waste your time at the dealership. **** here we are 2 weeks later and Carvana has done nothing but waste my time and inconvenience me and my family. I do not recommend and I will not be a returning customer until this company can fix its horribly  dysfunctional system.",no response,No response

After1 month it developed a rattle and a leak in the cooling system.One of their mechanics broke the return ****** off the radiator and instead of fixing it the correct way the shoved a plastic **** fitting in it and siliconed it in. After 2 months The truck went to the shop for cam phasers and a new oil pan gasket and a new battery. It was in the shop for over a month.1 month later it goes back to the shop for vvt selooids and iews it was in the shop this time for 3 weeks.2 days later it goes back in for vct selonoids.It's been there for almost a month now. I've had the truck for 7 months it's been in the shop for almost have that time. 33 thousand dollar truck I use to run a small business and after many calls and reading countless reviews I've learned the hard way what a horrible company carvana really is. No help with a rental no help on trading this price of c*** for a different truck.

The key fobs that were shown on their web page were not the ones we received, and the emergency keys were blank, so if the battery died, we had no way to get in the car . We had to go to a local shop to get the parts needed, and wait two weeks for them to come in, then we had to go to the dealer, which is 40 miles away twice to have them programmed. To their credit, they did take care of it. The car also had many paint defects that were not listed. Also, there were some spots that appeared to be caused by some sort of chemical on the window trim that were not shown.  At first, they weren't going to fix it, saying it is part of normal wear and tear. They backed off of the claim denial after I told them I had not left a review yet. Their  so-called ""detail"" appeared to be just a wash and interior cleaning. I used to detail cars, and this car was by no means detailed. Also, one of the floor mats pictured on the web page was missing; however, they did offer me $100 and sent me the right floor mats, so give them credit for that. It has been a little over a month since we had the car, and we have finally got all the issues fixed. Carvana does stand behind their product, but I don't think their inspection process is as thorough as they would have you believe. But after all, they are still a used car dealer.

They offered me a price (without even looking at the car yet), and walked me through the documents they needed me to upload. Once all of those were uploaded, and reviewed, they had me schedule an appointment for either me to drop it off or have them pick it up from the house. I choose for them to pick it up from the house, which they did not charge for nor reduce the price they offered me. The day of the appointment came and they showed up on time with the iconic Carvana flatbed truck. Both employees were very kind and helpful when signing the final papers. One walked around the car and took pictures of it while the other talked us through how the payment would work. Within 25 minutes they were pulling out of the driveway and that was that.When it came to payment I chose for them to direct transfer it into my bank account. We had our appointment Saturday and by Monday morning the full amount they offered me was in my account. The great thing is they never negotiate. They offer you a high competitive price for your car (about 3 grand more than the dealership was willing to pay), and pay you that full offer amount at the appointment. I highly recommend selling your car with Carvana to avoid the headaches of privately selling and avoid the intimidation that comes with interacting with a dealership.

The agent confirmed everything looked complete and no further action was needed. Today (January 31) I noticed the transaction had disappeared from my account again.

He let me take a test drive in the car for a few minutes and check it out. I accepted the vehicle and took it in my garage to take a better look. As I reviewed the features that I PAID for such as a power liftgate and keyless start the features did not exist. I YouTubed and did everything I could to ensure I was not missing anything but the buttons for those features simply did not exist. I called to tell them I wanted to return the car due to the lack of features. I requested that the shipping cost of $590 be refunded since Carvana lied about the car features on their website. They told me there would be no refund since the delivery was handled through a third party. Hmm. Carvana couldn't take money out of their pocket to refund me?

Very frustrating as there was no effort to identify an alternative process to make up for their mistake/snafu.  No compensation or recompense was available for this delay and aggravation.

So my husband called, and the person he talked to stated that they would be overnight some paper work that needed to be signed otherwise my daughter would be ticketed.  No paperwork came. On December 17th, we received another message about missing documents, so my husband called again. And again, he was told that they were overnighting paperwork. So we received an email on December 19th that the paperwork had been sent Fed Ex  and we had not returned it yet using the prepaid label.... And again, we received nothing! We were threatened in the email for legal action, so I responded telling them to get in touch with the *********/******** office and get the paperwork that was signed on November 26th. My husband called again and was told that it was on its way. On December 20th, we received another email that they were sending the paperwork again. On the 21st, we received an email that we needed to send the paperwork back via the label provided to avoid legal action and that we were at risk of not receiving permanent plates, getting a ticket for not having the plate, and being in default under our purchase contract which could lead to legal action!

Long story short - bought a truck on December 17th and the delivery was delayed FOUR times (without being given any reason). Finally the truck was delivered on the January 22nd, but the truck was advertised WRONG. It was advertised as an 8ft bed, but it was 6ft. No apology, no money back, nothing. I had to pay for a month of insurance (because Carvana makes you get insurance before the vehicle is delivered) and they won't do anything to reimburse me for that month of unnecessary car insurance. They removed all my contracts from the website and they don't send contracts to your email, so I have no contract that says I even paid for this vehicle. They said they will reimburse my bank account in full....but we'll see. Unbelievably dishonest, and nonexistent integrity.

I lost my previous car to a flood so I was pretty desperate for a vehicle. I used a rental car which got pretty expensive really quick! I rented it through the day that Carvana was supposed to deliver my car. Then I was notified that my car would be late so I had to spend another several hundred dollars on the rental car. They did not seem concerned about this at all. I got my car in July and I had a set of paper tags which expired October 1st. Just before that date they emailed me and explained that there was a delay and sent a new paper tag. A police officer told me The tag was illegal. So I called them and the guy seemed really surprised by this. He said it was a legal dealer tag. Then they told me they had changed third-party vendors who handled the registrations so there would be a delay and they sent me a different paper tag and $250! They said it might be faster if I went down to my local office so I called them. I could not register the car or get a legitimate paper tag because the car was not linked to me at all! At the next call I was told that there was a typo in the title which caused a delay. On the next call I was told that my title was lost. On the next call I was told that my title had been found and now sent to the third-party company which files with the **** I have made five payments on my car already as well as a down payment.

So we canceled the reservation. 2nd car - Went to pick it up, and the brakes made a terrible noise and jiggled.

Cancelled. 4th car - Called to verify we had the funds in our account, but instead of just verifying, Carvana withdrew the funds before we had even test driven the vehicle. This was around January 3rd..pickup was supposed to be Jan 11th. So by the time it cleared, and they refunded we might not have the funds to pay for the car. So we told them to hold on to it. Fast forward to 1/11, car gets delayed in transit. So now pick up is 1/18. Annoying, but whatever. They offered to pay $25 per day for the delays. We got an email at 3 am the day of pickup (1/18) telling us it's been delayed to 1/31. I called Carvana, they said this one got damaged as well. ?? At this point we are done.

It will probably take up to 2 weeks, for it to be completed, and I can purchase it then.  They were supposed to email me every week, giving me updates about the Murano. 3 weeks went by, and I hadn't received an email update from Carvana.  So I called customer service, and the representative was working remotely from home.  I  told the rep, I haven't heard from them in 3 wks, what is the update on the Murano.  They said it was still going through inspection.  I called a week later, and spoke to a rep, and they were working remotely from home too.  They didn't know where the car was, and I should be getting an email update soon.  I was without a vehicle for a month. After repeatedly calling customer service several times, speaking with a rep working remotely from home again, @ mid November, I still didn't have any updates. No one knew where the Murano was. I canceled my reservation nd asked for the refund of $100 back. The customer service is bad, dealing with someone working remotely from home, who doesn't know who to contact about the vehicle you're trying to get, is not good service at all.  I started searching for a vehicle through another site. I contacted the people, made an appointment to see the vehicle and purchased it that day.   I will never tell anyone to purchase a car through Carvana, cause that experience was horrible.",no response,No response

Copies of your driver's license, copies of your trade-in title, proof the vehicle is insured, etc. The day before scheduled delivery, they advise the vehicle will be delayed 4 days. I was disappointed but was okay with that. The day of delivery, one hour before the scheduled time, they call and advise that they can't deliver the vehicle because there is a ""problem with the lug nuts"". This alone sounded very suspicious to me given the fact that they claim that all of their vehicles are top quality and all go through a 150 point inspection. I find it more likely that they damaged the vehicle at their lot/hub and were being less than honest. I was advised that I could have $250 off the purchase of a different vehicle. I laughed that off because I have no intention of ever doing business with Carvava again. Very poor customer service and their vehicles are overpriced. Always check the vehicle history report of their vehicles. Numerous trucks that I looked at had ""fleet use"" in the history. This usually means that the vehicle was part of a rental fleet.

Note, these repair shops cringe at working with Silverock or have already dropped Silverock. I bought a 2020 Q5 and incurred over $1200 dollars to get a manual in English, dents repaired, purchase floor mats, detail car (thats right no manual, no floor mats and the car was dirty)! The customer service is the worst I have ever experienced in buying dozens of cars over the years. While this eels like a really cool way to buy; the thrill ends when it is delivered and you are left handling everything yourself! Ive had much more honest interactions with an individual seller!

I needed a bigger car so I wanted to trade in the first car I chose.  I applied again through the website (Carvana) with my trade in . I was offered an amount for that vehicle, and approved again for financing so I am now able to shop for a new car I want matching the criteria I choose. I used the price for a car ,no more than ****** with no downpayment because I wanted to trade, I also used mileage, make and model.  I was shown all the terms to receive the vehicle I chose this showing zero dollars down with my trade in the monthly payments,all other pricing terms and how much I'm supposed to save for trading in my current car. I was shown a negative balance for the downpayment . It never said I would have to be responsible for the downpayment while shopping through the cars.  I was led to believe I was not going to have to come up with a downpayment because of this information I was given on this website. No one ever contacted me about a downpayment or for any other reason the second time I contacted Carvana with my trade in.  Now I have to return the second car I received . As I was approved to receive this car it also said that payment was approved showing up in bright green , for approval. l wanted to keep the new car but will have to return it because of this problem.  I'm very upset about this and feel this should be addressed so no one else falls into this same problem and is let down. Emotional stress like this is unnerving, causing emotional pain and suffering for some people. I also had problems the first time with securing the actual vehicle I originally choose with size in mind and that I am able to afford, I was contacted by a representative for verification process and procedures things I needed to clear up, I asked him was I going to lose the original vehicle i chose because I had already been approved for it and was almost close to the end before this information was required. I'm at work when I was contacted by the representative.  I was allowed time by my manager to take my call to take care of this situation.  I can not use my phone at work other than this time but I still had 3 hours left before I can leave so I needed to talk before it was another day gone by.The man said I would not loose the car I want but ,i do need to go  back on the website before midnight to secure it again that no i will not lose it. I even told him i was at work and couldn't do this until I get off  work at around 8 the call I received was at 5:30 so I didn't think I would lose the car I want because he said I would not. He really had no clue ,lied or just didn't care either way i feel its negligence This caused me to have to keep looking at cars for awhile until I could find one I wanted similar to the first car. I had to keep using ridesharing services until I had to break down and find something quick so I settled for something close to what I wanted but its not big enough for my family . When the first car came the driver told me the lock on driver side door didn't work at times causing the remote start to not work if the door will not lock. She also asked me if I wanted to send it back to get it repaired or chose a different car. By this time I am in need of a vehicle so I accept the car and agree to take it to a repair facility with Carvana network.  I was not informed of this problem until the car arrived and it was a burden having to go thru the entire process  .

I sourced my own financing and changed my insurance policy myself. I provided all the information for my trade in and was all set on my end. All Carvana had to do was get the vehicle on a truck in Arizona and to my location in ********. The original delivery date was December 2, 2021, was delayed because the customer service rep said they did not see my completed paper work in their document drop box. New delivery date was December 7, 2021. All was well and they were sending me automated updates for the transportation progress. I received a text message on December 6, 2021 saying ""Tomorrow's the day!"" at 8:05 am. At 9:56 am the same day I received another text saying the vehicle had experienced and transportation delay. When I called to see where the vehicle was I was told it was at an inspection station in Arizona, meaning, it never got on a truck and left the original storage location to make the trip to **. I was told I would receive a check after the 7 day return period for $250 as compensation for the delay. The new delivery date was set to be December 23, 2021, just in time for Christmas. I re-sign all of my documents and they increase the mileage allotment on my vehicle so it does not have to be appraised again. The day is now December 20, 2021, three days before I am supposed to receive the vehicle. I receive another text saying that the vehicle has experienced a transportation delay. I call customer service and again they say that the vehicle is currently at an inspection facility in Arizona. Meaning, again, the vehicle has never even graced a flatbed with its presence. The customer service rep is kind enough to speak with someone about the issue and tells me that they can increase the compensation check from $250 to $575. Unfortunately they are unable to increase the mileage on my trade (increased from the original ******* miles to *******) in to compensate for the now 6 more day of travel over the holidays and I will have to get it re-appraised if I go over the mileage amount. The new delivery date is now December 29, 2021. If I go over the mileage my trade will most likely be worth less so I am not really being compensated for the inconvenience and lies about the car being ""in route"" (via text) as much as they are really offsetting the possible change in trade in value. On a positive note their customer service reps have been very helpful in doing as much as they can for me as they can't really do anything about the company's awful logistics and shipping issues. 1 Star for overall experience so far and 1 star for their customer service for a total of two. Their lack of accurate knowledge of where the vehicles are and inability to assign some form of tracking an order is awful. Their compensation for their inability to deliver on their end of a signed contract is awful and honestly should be legally held responsible.

Like I have kids I cant afford to be stuck on the side of the road! The mechanic couldnt give me an estimated time of completion because the parts had to be ordered and its the holiday! Like WHAT?!? Carvana is straight up wrong for selling a car like this! What 150 point inspection????? How did these major issues get missed!

Almost 8 weeks later, we have no car and no title, which means we couldn't even dump the car if we tried. Carvana's response was to tell us to deal with Audi.",no response,No response

Their ***************************************** they intentionally push the issues on to their customers. The day I received the car(11/30/2021) I test drove it and immediately there was a warning that there was a malfunction with the blind spot monitoring. They convinced me to keep the car because it was ""easy"" to take to a SilverRock location to get fixed. I immediately scheduled an appointment with a SilverRock location. After dropping my car off, they notified me a couple hours later that I needed to get it fixed by ***** directly. I scheduled the appointment with ***** on December 13th, the earliest appointment. After *****'s inspection they came up with this list of items that need addressed: the blind spot monitor malfunction, brake fluid low and dirty, air filter dirty, both back tires need replaced due to screws, blades, and unevenly worn on the inside, key fob battery low, missing wheel well cover, and system needed updated. It is now December 16th and ***** still has not been able to figure out what is wrong with the monitor. They have replaced both multiple times and now they need to send out a regional engineer to try and figure out what is going on. I reached out to Carvana and they essentially told me it was my problem I had to deal with. Avoid this company at all cost. The convenience of buying online is absolutely not worth this headache and horrible customer service.",no response,No response
1751,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,12/16/2021,"Not how car buying should be- would be the understatement of a lifetime. My car buying experience with Carvana has and still is an absolute nightmare. I wish this review was shorter but a lot went wrong. So naturally, here is a novel.  I traded in and purchased a car from Carvana. I purchased a ****** *********- almost brand new on Carvana and traded in my Volkswagon Jetta.  In order to buy online, you have to start insurance, show proof of loan, along with other additional documents. I got my remaining balance Loan on 10/1/2021. The ********* was supposed to arrive on 10/4/2021. I got a call that day stating that upon further inspection the front end of the vehicle was damaged. The entire left front bumper was smashed. The delivery arm asked me  do you want the car like this to which I said no. They said they could get it fixed or I can take the car and then go get it fixed. I indicated I didnt want a damaged vehicle- so Carvana had the car fixed.  Just to note- I am now paying interest and car insurance on a car I dont have and wont have until 10/18/2021.  Car delivery day: I get the car delivered to my home and take it for a test drive. I notice that the windshield sensor is on saying there is not windshield wiper fluid. We open the hood, and it is full. The delivery driver cant get the light to go off.  Alas,  we come to the conclusion the sensor is broken.  Which is odd and disappointing because this car was in the body shop for over 2 weeks, but they still delivered the car with issues. At this point, Im buying a damaged vehicle and not the no accidents report I got on Carfax. I ask if they are going to discount the vehicle, which they say they will do $250 off.  They give me information on a company I have to file a claim with.  I then drove the car 15 miles away to get the mandatory inspection- They looked at the car for 2 seconds, and then said this needs to go to a dealer. I then stay on hold with their repair arm for 30ish minutes in the shop just so the man at the store could tell them the car needed to go to a ****** dealer. Great, ok. So I make an apt with ******, and take PTO to go- which is unfortunate. They dont have the part I go back on 12/21/21 to actually get the repair done- using more PTO. Plates: I get my ****** with a 2-week temporary plate- which is odd, but they said my new license plate should be in within the 2 week time frame. At this point not shocking, I dont receive it. I spend countless hours on the phone with Carvana to ensure they have everything they need to file to have the new plates put on. Sure enough, the plates expire. I call Carvana and let them know I dont have plates. They explain that the car was sold in Arizona and that there is some sort of hold to have the car registered in Michigan and it could take months ( its now 11/7- I technically bought the car from Carvana on 10/1/2021). The lady tells me she cant give me an extension since Carvana only gets 90 days post buying the vehicle to file. The representative then tells me oops, this got missed regarding applying for the new out of state plates. The lady on the phone suggests taking an UBER to the places I need to go.  I am for the second time not able to drive a car that Im paying on for about 72 hours.  I dont get a call back from Carvana( just FYI- you will be the one to be constantly following up with Carvana. If you think they will call you back or follow up with you- even if requested they wont)- Anyway, after a couple more calls the lady says we can give you another temporary plate which I get in my email. I ask how I am supposed to use this piece of paper. Their solution was  I know it sounds jankey but you can just put it in a freezer bag and attach it to the vehicle. Carvana gives me another $250 to cover my Uber Charges.  I finally got my plates on 12/10/2021. Trade in: This is probably the most frustrating and disappointing part of my interaction with Carvana- which is saying a lot because at this point because well, weve been for an unfortunate ride. Ive been on the phone with Carvana now less than ***** hours.  Carvana purchased the Jetta and took it with them on 10/18/2021 when they delivered the *********.  VERY much to my surprise I get a letter from my credit union 11/23 stating they havent received payment on my Jetta. I let the know that I sold the car on 10/18/2021 and Carvana should have sent a check for the entire balance.  Were back to the calling game. I call Carvana- the first lady says we sent a check on 10/1/2021. She asks I call my bank back. Nope, they dont have it. I call Carvana back she insists its been sent on 10/1/2021. I ask for confirmation the check has been cashed. Its now the day before Thanksgiving she says Ill reach out to the finance team and get back to you on Friday with an answer. No call ( of course), I call on Friday and Im really frustrated at this point, I get a male. He tells me there is nothing we can do until we hear back from the finance team. He tells me he will call me on Sunday. No Call. I call again on Monday- I am told that I was supposed to add the remaining amount of the vehicle onto my loan. I indicated that was false, and reference the vehicle purchase agreement. She says oops! Thats our bad, I dont know why we have that in the system. I ask that an overnight check be sent to my credit union. She says she can do that and gives me a ***** Tracking Number. I call my bank 3 days later, nope no check. I check the ***** tracking and says label created but hasnt been sent. I call Carvana again they indicate they forgot to send it out and then give me a new tracking number. Fast forward to 12/16. I get an email from my bank letting me know I have a delinquent account and my credit has gone down some what significantly. I am now spending time with the loss prevention **** of my bank to resolve the issue on my credit. Overall, this has been an absolute nightmare and incredibly infuriating experience. I cant tell you how many times I asked to be transferred to a supervisor in order to resolve this issues and the response is  we dont have that kind of structure at Carvana but someone will get back to you within 24/48 hours. Then I would never hear back. At the end of the day, Ive spent more than 100 hours ( calling, taking my car in, filing disputes, etc.).  If I had known it would be this bad, I would have just bought a car from the dealership. Spent the normal 3 hours in there and went on my way.",no response,No response

First in early November I purchased a ***** Silverado and the day before deliver I was told that the truck was damaged in transport. I was never shown proof of the damage. Fortunately they didnt have my money since it was being purchased with a cashiers check.I went ahead and found another truck a 2012 ***** Colorado. After waiting two weeks for delivery the truck was dropped off I provided payment and brought it to my mechanic to look it over. My mechanic got back to me and said the trucks undercarriage was completely rusted. Carvana made zero mention of this defect. I immediately contacted Carvana and they returned to pick it up. The truck was dropped off on Saturday and picked up on Thursday. Im seven days in and Carvana still claims to not have my check. This company is a disgrace.

I selected my second vehicle and it was just more down hill from there The rep closed out both contracts and my deposit was lost finally after 3 days a manager contacted me and corrected everything but wanted to penalize me because now I was pass my 7 days and initially would not switch cars when the car was finally delivered I got stuck with a car that could have killed me my mechanic would not let me drive it because the axles were cracked and broken and he couldn't believe they sold it to me that way and right when everything thing was to be fixed the warranty ran out I so upset with a company that is so money hungry they have no regards to the customers well being at all so thumbs all the way down,no response,No response

However, on the day of my scheduled delivery, Carvana never showed up with my car. I am an understanding and reasonable person - so I would have been receptive of a delay, transportation issue, etc. I received ZERO communication in regards to the delay. I was at home waiting for my delivery for well over two hours and never once received a phone call, text, or email to notify me that my car would not be arriving on time. After multiple phone calls and several hours of waiting to speak to an actual person who could tell me what was going on, I was informed that the car I ordered was not even in my state and that the delivery had been rescheduled later in the week. Again, NO ONE COMMUNICATED this to me. I made the decision to cancel my order. To me, not communicating with someone who is spending $30k with your company is a RED FLAG.

We purchased a ****** Rogue that had listed a 3rd row seat in the vehicle . When we received the vehicle, no 3rd row seat. This was the primary reason we were looking at the Rogue to begin with. I spoke with the delivery person who advised me to take delivery of the vehicle and to call Carvana and they would make it right. 7 days in to dealing with this nonsense , I just scheduled the vehicle to be picked up. After reaching out to a local dealer, I was advised that the 3rd row seat could be installed for around $500 in parts plus the labor. I called Carvana back with these details, as to me, this made the most sense. They did not have to send a driver back down to pick up the vehicle, pay for the gas and time of the driver and the loss of a sale. I was told by the Carvana rep, they would not do this. I then ran the information in *** to see if the vehicle was priced correctly as it had no 3rd row seat as advertised. The selling price of the Vehicle $20,990. The *** price on the vehicle when I run it by the **** $19,156. NOT below the *** of the vehicle. My thought was that it was priced this way because the vehicle was listed with a 3rd row seat, which it clearly does not have. So I called back into Carvana, to be told they would do nothing with the purchase price of the vehicle either. UNREAL! So, I asked to speak with a supervisor. This made absolutely no sense to me. After waiting a day and a half for a callback, nothing. I called back in for an update to be told it would take up to 48hours for a manager or supervisor to call me back, pushing the purchase over the 7 day period.

It took four phone calls over the course of a morning to finally have somewhat of a meaningful conversation.  Even then representative number four couldn't answer all my questions.2.  My second complaint is that carvana should not dictate how you want to manage your finances.  If I have almost $16,000 of equity I should be able to pick and choose how much I want to put down into my new car., Yet carvana requires you to roll 100% of the equity.  And if you don't, you simply cannot do a trade-in so you lose in my case about $1,600 in this so-called Delaware state tax credit.In summary I feel that they have poor customer service because they simply couldn't keep me on the line continue to hang up and when they try to transfer they also hung up on me.  And it appears that there are technology or how they account for buys and sells a vehicle is not solid enough so that I am now a victim and losing $1,600 in a tax credit simply because their system is lacking",no response,No response
1765,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,12/12/2021,"Carvana advertised 150 point inspection buyer beware. When the car got to me. I had to replace the drive side rotor because it was warped, theres no way no one couldnt tell there was a issue at any speed with the rotors. Complete safety issue. Car wasnt safe to drive from day 1. But the issues didnt stop there. Someone had cross threaded the bolt to the caliper and the bolt was barely even in. Had to buy a tap set to redo the threads. 150 point inspection? No!! False advertising - carvana advertised in what came with my car and had the photos of upgrades on it. While it wasnt the main reason for purchase of the car It was a $500 sound system option that came with the car. When the car arrived it was missing. You could tell it was there and whoever took it just left the plug laying there. They didnt even try to hide it was gone. I immediately tried to contact anyone to help with the fact and carvana never responded. I tried multiple times. Never a response so good luck if something wrong with the car.Advertised damage to car - while I thought it was a cool feature when I got the car there was way more damage to it and beyond noticeable. That should have been mentioned. When I looked at my car it claimed it had some normal paint chips here and there and I was completely cool with it. When it got to my house there was more scratches then listed. Rust spots from front to back. Evidence that someone broke into the car bc the driver side door area is scratched all to h*** between the driver door and body and bent at the window so the door isnt flush with body. While the door doesnt leak this is still issues not listed. Not photographed, and not mentioned. In closing I wouldnt buy from carvana again. While it was nice I admit to just sit at home and buy a car. The reality was carvana is just a cheap used car lot trying to get maximum dollar for whatever they have in there inventory.

BUT THATS NOT HOW IT GOES! First,  I ordered my car my delivery was delayed within 24 hours after purchase.  I had to get a rental car since I would no longer have a car to drive because I had sold my old car in a timeline that matched with the purchase of my new car. When I told Carvana I was not satisfied with this and would like them to provide reimbursement for my rental car they said that they do not offer that. Then, the day of my delivery, the driver was a few hours late. Which is horribly rude and annoying. The guy, ***** was nice and polite, but it was hugely inconvenient. He got my car off the truck bed and informed me that 1) the mileage was ****** miles different than what was reported (I was ok with this since it was in my favor, but still, what the heck?), the car had not been detailed, the gas tank was empty, and there was a nail in the tire. He offered to take the car back and rectify all of those things- but that I would have to reschedule my delivery and that we would be looking at another week or more.  Obviously, I declined since once again, I would have no car to drive. I had returned my rental car in anticipation of getting my car that day. I called CARVANA several times to discuss these issues and spent hours on the phone. HOURS!!!! The customer service people are nice, they are. But, my word they are NOT helpful. They all give different info and there is no follow through on anything. I asked for a manager to call me several times to discuss the mileage discrepancy. I wanted to make sure the car would be titled and registered correctly. NOBODY HAS EVER CALLED ME BACK.  It's like they do not care at all. I was also told that I would get reimbursement for the lack of detailing. I am still waiting on those checks. I was told my a customer service ""lead"", ******, that ******************** does reimburse for rental cars. It's like $25/day, which is hysterical. But I am still waiting on those checks. I have had my car since 9/2021 and still have not received my title or registration. I have called several times and get told different things. 1) the registration people are not customer facing and will not speak to customers, 2) it is a 3rd party and once the documents go to this company there is no way for CARVANA to get information about where things are in the process. So, will the mileage be reported correctly on the title/reg? I don't know. When will I get those documents? I don't know. I also called CARVANA to asked about my reimbursement checks. The two gentlement I spoke to: ***** and ****** said that they are pending approval and have been for a couple months.  I was called later by ****** to say that CARVANA approved only half the amount promised to me. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. NONONONONO",no response,No response

1780,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,12/09/2021,"I purchased a car through a trade of my own vehicle, and within 16 hours the supposed new used car was totaled because the whole engine and motor went out. This would have been my second purchase from Carvana, but this second go around, they tired selling me a LEMON. SO i signed all of these documents stating that the car had been inspected, a 150 point inspection and the same thing was stated on the website. So needless to say instead of test driving the car around the city where I went to pick it up from, I chose to test drive it home on Monday night. My drive as about 23 miles from the vending machine location. When I got in the car, there was a mechanical light on, only one, and that was the tire pressure light. By the time I got home, and I had to drive it home using the interstate, the car started jerking and acting funny when it got up around 70 miles per hour. That was red flag number one. Then my son and I pull into a fast food place to pick up dinner and I start to hear this loud ticking noise like the motor was knocking. I proceed to drive it around the corner to my home, because now I'm back in my city. I pull into the neighborhood in this pretty luxury car, and it's making enough noise to wake the neighbors up. My husband comes out to see what's going on because it wasn't making this sound at the VENDING machine lot. He's no mechanic but obviously something major is wrong. So I get on the phone call the vending machine location here in NC, and they say sorry for this issue, but since you don't want to move forward with the purchase and or taking the car to one of their repair shops, and I would have to pay for a rental in order to get back and forth to work, and be reimbursed sometime in 2022, or who knows, they told me that I would have to make an appointment to return their car and get my trade in back. So needless to say, I made the appointment for this Wednesday morning. On Tuesday morning, on my way to work, the car stalled in a very busy intersection, it wouldn't change gears, go into neutral or anything. The tow truck driver had to drag the car out of the road because the motor, transmission and the whole system had gone out. I had sat in the intersection getting cursed out for more than a hour and a half waiting on Carvana's Silverlight towing service to show up, then it took that guy over and hour to figure out how he was going to get the car up unto his tow truck because it wouldn't start and it wouldn't change gears or anything. He ended up having to use a cable to drag the vehicle up onto his wrecker. No one from Carvana has called to apologize or say here can we compensate you for your time and hours missed at work, or just for the embarrassment of trusting them and their company and website. They then tried to make me wait until Wednesday to get my trade back, but I told them that I was coming to get my car no matter what, because that is their policy, if you don't like their car for any reason you can get yours back or get out of the contract. Luckily they had not started to inspect my car the very next morning, so it was still at the vending machine location, and the guy we will just call him TJ, looked for my car personally and told me to come get my car that day instead of waiting until Wednesday because that would have left me without a car and I would have missed work again fooling around with ole bogus Carvana. Be careful, because they don't care. Now I have two vehicles showing up on their financing site, they need to remove it immediately, as TJ stated that the contracts were null and void and the contract was dismissed due to the circumstances surrounding my purchase and trade.",no response,No response

1784,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,12/08/2021,"I recently purchased a vehicle from Carvana in October 2021, which was a pleasant experience in the beginning. 2 months have passed and my car started acting up, the check engine light came on, water wouldnt stay in the tank, it was shaking, all sorts of issues. Well I took it to a local business to run the computer on it to see what was going on, it came back with high idle, abs not responding, and mass air flow sensor bad. Well then i proceeded to contact Carvana to discuss this issues. They proceeded to tell me i have to contact silverock and file a claim. There was no in network shops that would take my car, so i reached back out to Carvana, i spoke with a really nice woman and she set me up with a place to accept my car but it was over an hour away from me. So she set me up with tow services, I felt a little at ease. Well the next day after my car was picked up i still hadnt heard from the auto shop to see if my vehicle was there, i proceeded to call them and the man said My Car NEVER got there. At this point i was livid, i contacted the tow company they said i have to call Silverrock, i contacted them they said i had to call Carvana. So im on the run around searching for my car again and the tow company took it to a completely different place. Well Carvana says just let them fix it we will figure it out and help you. Ok well my car is sitting at the repair shop now for 7 days, i have no means of transportation to and from work and the mechanic calls me and says the camshaft needs to be replaced, the ignition coil is cracked, sparkplugs are bad, the coolant container is cracked, the front brake pads are so bad its to the metal, and the oil pan and sealant is broken. Wow so now i am completely overwhelmed again, They contact Silverock to start a claim. Silverrock does not want to cover all of the damages. I called Carvana AGAIN yesterday, they tell me I have to pay out of pocket theres nothing they can do. These problems came with the vehicle and obviously I was lied to about the inspection they supposibly do before selling the vehicle. Now i am in the process of getting a lawyer i have had this car for only 2 months and cannot even get them to help me pay for the problem they sent to me.",no response,No response

Battery died a little over a week later, no biggie, no way to tell when that happens,Silver Rock replaced. Brakes started making a noise-turns out, NO BRAKE PADS.  Repair was covered by Silver Rock, but seems like that is something that should have been caught during the inspection.  Then, I started getting emails stating that I was missing registration papers-nothing on the dashboard telling me what was needed, three phone calls, three different answers, 1st- we will re-send-never received them, 2nd-oh, that's not for you, that's for the hub, you shouldn't be getting those emails, THEN I started getting emails saying if I did not return the paperwork-which I never recieved-I could face legal repercussions since I was not following the contract agreement, 3rd call today-request has been submitted-2 days ago-to resend forms, it's still waiting.  Temporary plates expire in 11 days, so we cannot drive the car-they MIGHT upload a new plate, but after ***** hours if it's not there, to call to get it.  So, through no fault of my own, we may be not be able to drive the car-luckly we have a 3rd car, but that is beside the point.  And talking with the customer service rep today, I just wanted to her acknowledge that the issue was on their end and not me, she just kept reading from a script.

I am a disabled veteran and I told them from the beginning that I needed to do my own registration because it requires special documents.  They told me since I am transferring my plates from a vehicle that was totaled due to an accident it would not be difficult.  I ask them are you sure? I bought the vehicle in October and according to them it has been submitted to Nevada DMV.  I have not heard anything yet.  I need the registration and disabled plates ASAP.  Due to my disabilities it requires me to park in the handicap.  I depend on those plates to park in a handicap spot.  I do not want the handicap placard!  Now I am paying car insurance for a vehicle I no longer have costing me more money because the state of Nevada requires; before you drop your insurance you need to turn in those plates.  Since I am transferring the plates the vehicle I purchase I can not drop the insurance costing me more money.  I am so disappointed and I do not recommend to buy from them.  Since then I bought my son a vehicle and my husband got a vehicle and I have register both vehicle all in one month.  I do not understand why this is taking so long.

1790,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,12/07/2021,"I chose to go with Carvana because I initially wanted to sell my car and out of everywhere I looked, they offered me the most for my vehicle. I later changed my mind to do a trade in and found what seemed to be a great deal on an available car. This was October 29th to be exactthe day I placed my order. The delivery date was scheduled for November 3rd. Everything seemed sooooo easy, justtttt like they advertise. Little did I know, unless the car advertising says its already with Carvana and not in the marketplace like mine does, youre in for a bunch of excuses and lies. Over a month later, and after rescheduling at least 6-7 times at this point  (probably more), and resigning the contract each and every time they reschedule, I still DO NOT have my vehicle. Not to mention I spoke to a representative who lied and literally told me it was in transit to me. Let me tell you, I have spoken to God knows how many reps whom all they could do is make excuses on the companys behalf, because Im sure they know this is a bunch of BS. I was lied to about the car being ready for pickup, I was lied to about the car being in transit, I was lied to about the car being worked on still, and to top it off, they seemingly have no supervisor to speak to. Probably for good reason. They cant possibly pay anyone who works there enough to lie AND deal with the consequences. None of the reps can call the center where the car is to find out an update, only by email. Completely sketchy. They told me the car has a cosmetic issue, and they blame the CONSTANT pushback for delivery on Covid. Id like to think, Were far enough into the pandemic that a company should have found a new or more efficient way to operate, Im not buying any of that. I am beginning to think that someone who is working on the car wants it and is hoping if they push the delivery back enough, I will give up so they can have it, or that there is a mechanical issue that is not being disclosed to me. Either way, Im getting excuses thrown at me everytime I speak to someone. Furthermore, I find it EXTREMELY hard to believe that any cosmetic issue that ISNT major takes over a month to fix. Come on now. Somebody is lying. Then they went from saying the car was fixed to there being no one available to deliver the car then back to oh the car is still not ready. Absolutely No one is on the same page when you call; everyone says something different. Like the imbecile who told me my car was in transit to be delivered and I rearranged my entire schedule for nothing. Only to get a text that the delivery needed to be rescheduled and the next rep the following day to tell me, the car never even left where it was. Not to mention, If your car goes over a certain mileage, they will ****** $1k from your trade in offer with quickness. Then they give you a certain mileage not to go over while waiting on delivery but consistently push back the delivery. Ive had to stress the issue to get approvals for additional mileage while they take their sweet time lying about whats really going on with the car and why it hasnt been delivered yet. I ABSOLUTELY NEVER leave reviews, let alone bad ones; Ive worked in customer service my whole life and I know how important it is that a good experience be offered and how much a bad review can affect a brand. But this.oh, someone needs to know about this. Their sketchy protocols need to be exposed. Some poor soul is looking for a car and has no idea the whirlwind of lies they are about to be told. Somebody is watching the Carvana commercial and thinking maybe I should try that. Do yourself a favor and go on CarGurus, AutoNation, or some other LEGITIMATE means of buying or trading or selling. No one should be wrapped in a loop of lies, false advertisement, and no upper management to escalate and actually fix the situation. I hope whoever reads this thinks twice. Find a dealership, youll get your car probably cheaper with less mileage and for sure a h*** of a lot faster. I was already skeptical of them to begin with because their prices; some of the cars are overpriced for the mileage they have because lots of them are probably fleet vehicles, the year they are, and the type of car it is. Honestly if I wasnt trading, they wouldnt have been on my list anyway. Carvana and their false advertising isnt worth it, not by a long shot. Ive never had a used car before and I was hoping for peace of mind with this process; my main concern has always been something going wrong with the car that will cost me thousands at once. Thats why I opted for a newer car, as I felt at least its under warranty for a while. But I decided to give Carvana a chance and Im extremely disappointed. Not to mention nervous as to what the real issue is and how Im supposed to feel comfortable driving off with the car after it took so long to fix. I opted out of their expensive Carvana Care and my nerves are shot with the amount of time this is taking. Im starting to feel Ill need extra coverage just in case. This was supposed to be a quick process to save some money and has DEFINITELY turned out to be the WORST car buying experience Ive had.",01/20/2022,Update: I was later told the car had mechanical issues that they were trying to fix and could not. Just as I suspected to begin with. I lucked out on one phone call I made and got a supervisor who admitted the car had several issues that I initially had no knowledge of because of everyone's run around behavior and lies.

( very nice person who deserves a better employer) waited on hold for 30 minutes while he researched the issue.  Then I was told I needed 2 additional documents to prove residency because my drivers license didnt match my home address.  I explained my drivers license does match my home address.  Because I requested the vehicle be delivered to my place of work they assumed I was living at my work address. Another technical error.  30 minutes later was disconnected while being placed on hold.  **** called me back and stated due to me having the car delivered to my work it would cost me an additional $499.00.

1801,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,12/03/2021,"DO NOT BUY. Bought a vehicle. The delivery date got pushed a couple days back. No big deal. I drove the car to work the next day and it stalled out in an intersection. I figured I did something wrong so I kept driving. On the way home from work the same day the car did it again. This time realizing the clutch was sticking to the floor. After Carvanas 150 pt inspection figured this wouldve been caught. Called customer service to swap the vehicle out. The earliest date I could get was a week later. So I said ok and parked the 1st vehicle since it was unsafe to drive. I paid for Ubers to and from work 20 miles one direction. The day before delivery I get a text saying the delivery will get pushed back another week. I called and the first customer service agent said he was putting in a priority logistics ticket and would call me back in 30 minutes with an update. I called customer service back an hour later with no resolution. This rep asked if I would be ok choosing a car that was more local to where I am located. So I switched cars. He told me delivery would happen next day and said that was a firm delivery date. Again I was happy with this resolution. An hour later I get a call from underwriting trying to schedule my delivery for another week out. I told them I couldnt do that and the car needed to be here asap. They offered me a check to try and make things right but ultimately I ended up having to settle for 4 days out from ordering what is now a 3rd vehicle. 3rd vehicle arrives. Before I can even start looking around the vehicle I notice the rear bumper is cracked and dented. I let the agent know that he needed to put notes in on that to get fixed because the damage was not reported on the ad and is almost bad enough to consider the car being in a wreck. I walk to the front of the vehicle and find more damage on the front bumper where someone has ran in to something and gashed the bumper. These gashes range from 4 up to ************************************************************************* fixed up. They were very quick in getting this damage sent in and getting me an email with a drop off location. The paint and body shop they want me to take it to is a maaco. Where they will paint your whole car for 500$. Anyone who has any respect knows to stay away from a maaco paint job. Even the reviews for the location they sent me mention overspray, drips, bad clear coat, terrible customer service etc. Now Ill be calling to figure out what other shop I can take the vehicle to to get fixed and again Ill be without a car waiting for repairs that I shouldnt even need. Today is the day after the 3rd vehicle arrived and I noticed my bank accounts didnt look right. So I check my account to find that Carvana went and charged me again for a down payment that they already have. Called customer service to get this resolved and waiting on a call back now. I had to tell the girl I spoke with to please call me back and update me because the other people I dealt with that said they would call back never did. All in all the cars that they offer have not been inspected. They dont get inspected visually before they get loaded on the truck on delivery day. **************** doesnt call back. They offer checks of 250 each to help smooth things over even though Ive been going on 2-3 weeks with nothing to drive. 250 doesnt cover small rental cars in my area or Ubers to and from work. This has been the absolute worst experience. And even now Im still going through it with them. I have no idea when Ill be refunded my down payment. And Ill probably be without a car for another week or 2 when I get the body damage fixed. My advice. Stick to traditional car buying. This has not been easy at all.",no response,No response

When I drove over 60mph, the entire steering column shook. Clearly the 90point inspection missed a few things. They were fairly good about the 7day return. My replacement car was 100 times better.

The listing stated that it came with 2 keys which is what I was looking for. I priced that into my decision to pick that particular car.When the driver showed up he stated that he only had 1 key. I had him call his office and no one could find the 2nd key. Since I had a 7 day period to test drive the car I accepted delivery but started a complaint with Carvana to get the 2nd key.1st they told me that I'd have to start a claim with the warranty provider Silverrock. Once that was done I was told I had to contact one of the repair shops in the network. I live in Southern ********** and there are repair shops and tons of dealers out here. Basically it was 95% *** Boys listed. Anyway, they don't even do key fob replacement and programming.So I was told I was now allowed to contact a dealer to get the key but I had to tell the dealer to call a number and deal with a third party warranty. Now if you ever dealt with dealers and third party warranties you might appreciate the time consuming efforts here. I'm trying to schedule that, follow up with the dealer and do so before my time period runs out.Now, Carvana says they will cover the cost for the key fob but what they are not considering is the cost of my time and effort to do the leg work here and get this handled for something that was no fault of my own.If you use Carvana just be aware if anything goes wrong it will probably turn into a hassle.

This company really makes conventional car dealers look great. I sold one vehicle last year and it worked out well. My second experience was trading a SUV to buy a smaller car. First car was ***** Cruze which condition was severely understated. It had a rear end rattle and the paint on the hood had so many stone chips it looked terrible. Neither condition was ever mentioned in the description. I sn it back and had a Cadillac CTS delivered. Again it has issues !! He sunroof retracting cover is broken and power door on drink holder is inop. Nobody thats breathing could miss this on an inspection. They claim they do a 150 point inspection and change the oil. Both of those policies from this company are fake news !! Neither one was done and car arrived dirty on the outside and they use some kind of cleaner that smears up all of the interior. In all my 45 years of buying, trading and selling cars Ive never had such a horrible experience. I will NEVER do business with them again. I am know in the 7 day decision period on this Cadillac CTS and not sure they will fix the two items needing repair. I simply do not trust this company whatsoever. They have great idea but have sadly ruined this business model so bad its impossible to buy a decent automobile or truck.

1815,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,11/29/2021,"I purchased a car from Carvana in September 2021 when I first ordered the car I set it up for delivery. My delivery date was supposed to be September 25, 2021. The day of my delivery I received a text message that said that the delivery has been delayed and that It was rescheduled for the 28th. So I called  Carvana to find out what was going on and was told that there was an issue with transportation and that they could not locate the car. So I said OK sounds a little sketchy but whatever I also had an issue with the date and that was because of my work schedule so they rescheduled it for the 29th. Once again the day of delivery I get a text message that says delivery has been delayed and was rescheduled for the first.  I once again call Carvana to find out whats going on and again they cannot find or locate the vehicle so they do a little digging and from what I was told they were experiencing issues with transportation and that was mainly because I guess they were using a third-party for their transportation and come to find out the car was not in **********, ******* as the website clearly ****** the cart should have been but was somewhere in Georgia. I said how is it that you cannor locate the vehicle? They could not answer that. So finally I get the car I test drive it and I was excited you know. While doing so I realized that the auto stop and start does not work but I didnt pay it any mind I was thinking OK well maybe Im not pressing on the break hard enough Im not sure Ill just give it some time and at this time I still had my seven days. So within those seven days Ive found that the auto stop and start did not work or at least it would only work when it wanted to but also that every time it did work it stopped fine but when I went to accelerate the car would do the sputter jerk like it was going to stall. I also found that my screen would go in and out like it would just completely shut down and then come back up OK so I called Silverock and Carvana and they decided OK well were going to file a claim and you can take it to some dealership within their network however the dealership was some hole in the wall repair center and when I called them they even told me hey you need to take it to capital Chevrolet because theyre gonna be able to work on the electrical problem and you should covered be under the manufacturer warranty  because the car has not made it to ****** miles yet.  its funny how they referred me to Chevrolet where I had been trying to go all along. So I talked to Carvana they decided they were going to send me a $200 check  that was just because of the delivery being delayed twice however, I was told that tgey could send it but it was  going to take up to a month before I would receive it because theyre not going to process it until after my seven days. I was like wow! Well the first time I took the car to ******* Chevrolet they said that they would go ahead and take a look at it however it would be the next day before they were able to actually do the diagnostic I said OK so I call capital Chevrolet the next day just to see where they were or if they had a chance to look at it. I get told that it would be about four days before they actually take a look at it so I said OK Im just went and picked up. Not to mention I had already talked with Silverock and Carvana about possibly getting a rental car because capital Chevrolet does not have loaner cars anymore they sold them due to the car shortage from the pandemic. Carvana would not do anything except direct me to Silverrock who then says they would only reimburse me and that would only reimburse me $40 a day up to $400 *** who has that type of money lying around for a rental car because according to your website the car should have been in top shape.  I definitely understand it is a used car however according to your website every test that the car has to go through before it is to be sold shows that the car had passed. So how is it when I get the car all of a sudden all of these issues start arising? As Im riding along now mind you I have not had the car for a full three months yet so far the auto stop and start does not work or works when it wants to,  my screen completely goes out and comes back up and now it changes colors it gets so bad that you can barely see the screen especially when Im on the interstate. The car shakes when I get up to about 50 miles an hour  and then thats because the speed limit out here is 70 mph on top of when I accelerate it doesnt go anywhere I can accelerate and it is  almost as if Im going 2 miles an hour.  The best way I can explain it is if youre riding a bike and peddling really fast but youre not going anywhere. Thats exactly whats happening with the car and the first time I had the car looked at by a mechanic he said all of my sensors needed to be replaced and there were some sensors that were not even there and should have been. So now here I am having to take my car back to capital Chevrolet because not only was I having all of those issues but my check engine light has come on and my traction control light has come on.   That is a issue for me because I have not  had the car for a whole three months yet so why is it that Im having all of these issues is but on your website it says that the car is in top shape for a used car and its certified. But every time I call Carvana or Silverock no one can help me well you are just going to have to take it to the dealer and let them look at it. You are approved for a one hour diagnostic and have all of these warranties so everything should be covered. As soon as I talk to Silver rock oh well you have to make sure that everything is covered because if not youre going to have to pay out-of-pocket (That is on top of the $50 deductible for this dealer not being in the network). why is it that I have to spend over $1000 on a rental and by the way none of this is made up I have proof I have pictures of my screen I have pictures of the check engine light I have the paper sitting right next to me now that shows that I paid over $1000 for this rental car and the funny thing about that is they tell me that if my car is not actively being worked on and is just sitting at the dealership for lets just say five days  those five days are not covered so basically they will not reimburse me for those five days that my car is at the dealership unless it is actively being worked on and what the dealership is telling me is that it is going to take at least a week or a week and a half before they even get a diagnostic  and once they do that diagnostic it still has to go to at least three or four different technicians because of all of the different issues that Im having with it but I am shelling out all of this money for a car that I just purchased! That is supposed to be in top shape for a used car and you cant do anything?! All I get is Im so sorry to hear that I definitely apologize. I dont need your apology what I need is my money back a new car or something because Im coming out of pocket I do not have the money lying around like that. This is not how you do business! So basically you sold me a lemon you lied on your website and you sold me a lemon. It gets even crazier! So three days ago two or three days ago I made my car payment for the 420 Ive received a message from Bridgecrest saying  thank you for your payment right after submitting my payment. Two days later I receive another message that says  your payment has been received however, they have not taken the 420 out of my account now that I have to go and get this car fixed I have dropped it off at the dealership already I have gone ahead and I have gotten the rental car theyve taken all of the money out of my account just for this rental car so now because Bridgecrest never took the funds from my account the payment is going to reverse so when I call them they say the only thing they can do is allow the payment to reverse  to which I then asked OK if it reverses doesnt that mean I have to pay a fee? oh yeah you have to pay the $15 fee and then call us back once it reverses so we can go ahead and set up an arrangement. So now I have to wait for the payment to reverse then Im gonna have to pay a extra $15 on top of the 420 I already have to pay  and then call back to make arrangements as if the payment was late when I already processed. Why send a message to say that the payment was received and you havent even taken the money from my account? thats not even the whole part. I speak to a rep from eto the people from enterprise Saturday who told me that  I could have the warranty company request a reservation on my behalf and that enterprise could change the rate based on that reservation. Why is the warranty company not informing people of this because I am pretty sure a lot of people do not know. So I call and they put in the reservation. I call enterprise this morning because the rep told me to wait until Monday as  I originally had the rental car for 10 days thats what I set the original reservation for. She said she could change the reservation until Monday once youve called your warranty company they should be able to send in the reservation once we get the reservation on Monday will go ahead and change it and if you need it for more days will can extend it. OK fine I call enterprise this morning because I had the confirmation number for the reservation that my warranty company has sent in for me the young man did not ask for my reservation number all he told me was we can go ahead and extend it so he extended it and I had to pay $638.65 on top of what I already paid on Saturday which was $464.38. I call silver rock and had the rep on the line to speak with the rep at enterprise so finally we got it straight and they got it down to $42 a day which was just a couple dollars less than what they already had which was like $48 a day what the rep from enterprise told me was they could not switch my reservation to the reservation that was sent from my warranty company because if that was the case I wouldve had to come in to cancel my reservation and redo the reservation  so they could switch it to what was sent from the warranty company but they would have to refund me all of my money and then Ill have to pay again to get the rental car now mind you its not going to immediately go back to my card so how long will it take for the money to be put back onto my card in order for me to make the payment for the car because once again who has money laying around like that? Ay! Im getting a heading just reading what I typed here.  Im sorry Im not rich I work hard for my money and I have a lot of bills to pay but heres the kicker I mean if the car was as your website said I wouldnt have to go through any of this I wouldnt have to pay out-of-pocket for anything at least not now I didnt think I was going to have to pay to get my car repaired within the first 2 1/2 months of purchasing it normally it takes years before your car starts to break down. However, she goes well let me check something because I asked her if we do that with the refund will I need to bring the car back or do I keep the car? How does that work? She says that I should be able to keep the car once the money is put back onto your card then I come back in so we can redo the reservation. OK fine she goes hold on let me check some information. She puts us on hold for about five minutes and then she comes back well unfortunately if we do the refund you would have to bring the car back until the money is put back onto your card and then we can redo the reservation and you can get the ent Al back. OK well right now this is my only mode of  transportation at least until I get my car back so what am I going to do? She then tells me she has changed my rate from my reservation to the rate  of the reservation that Silverock sent through so now I have whopping credit of $25 and some change. YAY!! (Not) I just shelled out over $1000 for a rental car I should not have had to pay for.

I have been trying to trade in my vehicle for a newer one. Unfortunately I have another family members name in the car I am trading in. The first time, I received a power of attorney so I could sign for them. Carvana told me it was against their policy to do this because their hq is in Arizona and I was in **********, I offered to get an Arizona POA and they declined. So I decided to wait to Thanksgiving liberty period and drive the trade in car to Utah, where my family member lives. I explained this to them and the need for the car to be delivered on the day they said it would prior to completing the order. Everything was set and two days before delivery I get a text that they had unilaterally pushed out the delivery date by a week. I called and let them know that wouldnt work, as I had previously explained prior to finishing my order, I had driven 12 hours to Utah to switch out the vehicle and I have to be back in ********** before the new delivery date. They confirmed the car was in ********* (5 hours away), but said it would take over a week for the car to make it to the delivery location. I asked they keep their word and to deliver it in the confirmed initial delivery date. I was told to call again on the delivery date to see if they could deliver it sooner. I suggested they should be the ones to call me instead of having me call them. They said they didnt have that ability (which is weird since they had called me numerous times throughout the process). Their unprofessionalism cost me an additional ***** miles on the vehicle I am trying to trade in (driving back and forth from **********) which they admitted would lower its trade in value with them. Unfortunate that a company this big doesnt care enough about its customers to keep its word of a material term of the contract (delivery day) and couldnt figure out how to drive a car 5 hours in 3 days.",no response,No response

I had received a rental through my insurance company at a reduced rate and returned the car following the start of a purchase being started November 12th. I was promised my car for the 17th, and on the morning of the day it was supposed to be delivered I received a notice that my car had been delayed 10 days. When I called to figure out what had happened I was told that there were reports of my car in two different states, and they weren't sure where it was or what had happened. 8 hours later I received a follow-up call to inform me that the facility that held my car (which was determined to be in ********** rather than the original thought of ***********) had a broken truck. The delay in the car was told to me to be primarily due to Thanksgiving, which I can understand. 9 days later, the morning before my car was supposed to be delivered on the SECOND scheduled time, I was again informed my car was delayed. It was now in my state two hours away but would take 10 additional days to get to me. When I asked what had happened, I was given a vague description of ""logistical complications"" and when pressed further it was elaborated to be paperwork. I asked what specifically had happened since I had been told my car would be delivered to the holding facility at the same time it was received, and yet would take another 10 days than expected to complete because ""there are a lot of cars"" despite my original call telling me that my car was now marked for priority. I am now expected to wait until December 7th, and am currently waiting for a call back from a ""leadership team"".I drive for a living and have had my hours reduced significantly since I HAVE NOT HAD ACCESS TO A CAR due to this insane situation. In order to make amends, they could either give me $750 back or I could begin the purchase of a new car entirely that would somehow be delivered a minimum of four days sooner than the car purchase that has been in process for 14 days now. I am disgusted with the treatment of my time and my money as well as the ridiculousness they have put me through. Prior to my experience, I had heard wonderful things about Carvana.

He received a car with 4 worn tires, one with dry rot, that would not pass state inspection. Carvana refused to take responsibility for any of this because it fell within ""Carvana standards"" - what standards don't align with state laws?

I still have to continue paying for insurance and the vehicle. Had to pay for almost 3 weeks of insurance before they even were able to get me the car as well. Their advice when asked what to do or what they'd be able to do to accommodate me was to take an Uber or ask a family member to drive me around until they show up. They would not be helping me and were not willing to compensate me. Thanks to ***** for attempting to help but if you're in a pickle or need a smooth experience THIS IS NOT IT! RUN don't walk away. I didn't pay all this money to be told to take an Uber. Also, good luck getting any sort of help after you sign the contract. The warranty service is great though, but that's through a third party. I've had my delivery date rescheduled many times, was told the vehicle was good to go and ready for my delivery date of Monday the 6th, got a text later saying it wouldn't be ready and could we possibly reschedule for the next day Tuesday the 7th. Something about a windshield wiper needing to be fixed. I said no problem we can reschedule. Got a text the following day asking if we could reschedule for thursday the 8th or could I pick it up myself. I asked why it would be so long to replace a windshield wiper and I declined to pick it up myself. A completely different sales rep showed up to deliver after the first rescheduling they told me they wouldn't be able to leave the car because it hadn't passed inspection. SO WHY BRING IT AND WASTE BOTH OUR TIME. Also, the website says you get a full tank of gas. The sales rep told me that it only had to be up to 3/4 full when I asked why the tank wasn't completely full, but I may have missed that in the fine print I guess, idk. There was also a weird noise with the ac so I was given the option to have them fix it or file a claim later. So I rescheduled again. Was asked multiple times if I could pick it up (mind you there's still a mandatory fee) I said no at first because I didn't want to have to pay the delivery fee AND pick it up myself to have to drive about an hour home. Rescheduled. Then a storm comes so I'm not upset that we had to reschedule again. The next issue is miscommunication. My sales rep called and said the ac issue had been fixed and that it just need to be cleaned and then asked me if I would be able to pick up the car and gave me two times to choose from. I was excited and asked if it was for sure. She said yes, flashforward to the end of the day and i get a call saying it's still not ready. So I call Carvanas help desk to ask if I could get more information about what is going on with the vehicle because I obviously don't want anything that has major issues. Was told by the representative that the car was having some sort of issues with cooling and it wouldnt be ready or even picked up until the day of delivery. Fine, but WHY WASTE MY TIME telling me the car is there and ready when it isn't.Pros: Easy to navigate, decent financing options, variety of vehicles, a pretty good chatbot, friendly reps and sales people, 7 day return, 100 day coverage for some parts, and a full tank of gas (not actually full, just at least 3/4 full apparently).Cons: constant miscommunication, no direct answers to questions for the most part, unclear and misleading information on what is and isn't included.",no response,No response

Carvana states, in thousands of places all over their website, that they  perform a 150 point inspection on their certified and marketplace vehicles.  The first car I received drove like it had blocks instead of circular tires in the rear and had multiple lights on in the dash, requiring ~$1,000 of service.  This car was certified and passed Carvana's own 150 point inspection.  A test drive is part of the inspection that this car passed.  How?  The second car had undocumented damages on both sides of the vehicle and the bumper was glued to the fenders to hold it in place.  I have pictures upon request.  This vehicle also passed the 150 point inspection.  How? Both vehicles were 2018 ******************* and both were returned to Carvana after several missteps by Carvana.  I was charged for the first vehicle and neither Carvana nor their lending partner, Bridgecrest, are able/willing to close the loan.  Neither will have the loan nor application removed from my credit report even though Carvana's fraudulent report (150 point inspection) duped me into believing I was buying a different car than the one they were selling, twice.  Literally every time I call Carvana I receive a different excuse as to why this problem cannot be resolved.  I have not been allowed to speak with anyone in a leadership role.  My pleas for a eturn call from leadership have been completely ignored.  One email was received that stated a commitment to having answers by 11/15/21, but no follow-up was ever received.  The car I traded in on 10/30/21 still has not been paid off and there are currently no plans to do so.  the reason for this changes every time I talk to someone at Carvana.  This means that I currently have loans open with payments due this month (Nov 2021) for the car I traded in and no longer have possession of, the Giulia that I did not keep and the new car I bought from a local dealership.  I have 3 open car loans and only have one car.  Carvana is in possession of both cars that I do not have but owe money to a lender for this month and cannot find a way to resolve this problem.

Nobody knows what they're doing and keep getting told different things.  They delivered my car and it hadn't even been looked at.   They claim on the website that they do a 150 point inspection.   There were so many little things wrong with my car that it was SO obvious it was run through a car wash and that was the extent of my ""inspection"".   Luckily, I got a good car, but not because of Carvana, it's just a good car.   Over two months later, I am still waiting for my refund for several things I had to replace.   Every time I call I get someone new who doesn't know anything and I get told different things EVERY time.   Will never do business with them again.   Do not recommend.

1845,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,11/17/2021,"I had a pick-up at the Birmingham location today at 2 pm. I arrived early because I did not receive any type of notification that my car was on time for delivery. Originally, I was supposed to pick up my car Monday 11/15/2021 but due to transit issues, I had to wait until 11/17/2021 to receive it. I walked into the Carvana on ********************************* in ********** and gave them my information and the guy stated my rep would be with me to assist me. The rep ************************* walked over to me and asked for my keys to get the mileage off the car I purchased first, as I was doing a swap because my first vehicle arrived with two deep scratches on the hood that was not listed on the website. Before ******* walked out to the car to get the milage I informed her that the mileage was over 400 miles and I informed her I spoke with several representatives that stated my mileage was extended an additional 200 miles for the inconvenience and the rep I spoke with the night before (11/16/2021) stated as long as I did not go over **** miles I should be okay. She looked in my notes and apparently none of that information was listed in the notes and I spoke with 4 Carvana reps before I walked into that location at 2 pm. ******* went out to check the miles on the car and came back and stated I needed to pay $13 for overage in which I stated I was not going to pay because of the previous representatives that stated my mileage was extended an additional 200 miles because my vehicle was delayed. ************************* then stated that she would call to see if the $13 could be waived. While she was calling the main office about the $13, my father was on his way to the location to review the car with me as he did the first night I received the first vehicle from Carvana. When he go to the location which was maybe ten minutes after ******* left me in the waiting area, we walked out to view the car to see if it was any imperfections or issues with the vehicle. After looking the car over, we walked back into the waiting area and waiting a few more minutes, my father walked over to across from where ************************* was sitting on the phone to see how long it would take and informed her I had to be to my class at 3:30 pm, in which she responded: ""I'm on the phone"". ********************** walked in and a conversation between ******* and Will was had for all of two seconds then ******* was headed to the printer, then to me. When she walked to the waiting area she asked if I could sit at another table from where I was already sitting to sign papers. When i walked over my father followed as any parent would, and he asked her how long would the process take because I needed to be in class at 3:30 PM, in which she responded ""I am dealing with her"", resulting in my father asking who the manager was because we were not pleased with the customer service and her response was ""I do not know who the manager is"" several times. After ******* stated she did not know who her manager was after being asked, my father, asked the other employees in the location who was the manager when ********************* walked around to assist. Once ********************* walked over to assist *************************** became very loud, irate, and aggressive as if she wanted to fight my father and me for asking for someone else to assist. ********************* asked what the problem was and we both informed him that we were not happy with how we were being treated and wanted someone else to assist, at that time ******* was still very loud and aggressive to the point the other employees asked her to leave the waiting area. I am extremely unhappy with the customer service today at the Birmingham location with that representatives.

Its since coming in 90 days since they said they would send me a check and still havent received anything. Was originally told, by next month, then it was 30 days, now Im told its ***** days. All to send a simple check. Carvana was quick to sell me a car and after that, seems as if they couldnt care less how it goes after the sale.

I was told (after the process was already started) they needed to rework the contract. Reason being CARVANA incorrectly entered the mileage on the vehicle and needed to fix it. During this time we were able to get temporary plates that I had to call each month to get updated, until September. They informed me that they were no longer able to send temp plates and I wouldnt be able to drive the car until the rework was finished. At this time I was also told that no progress had been made with the rework and they would get someone to look further into it. A couple weeks later I called to see where we were at, and that time they offered me $350 for me to get Ubers if need be. I had to call them three more times in the span of two months before I could get the check out to me. At this point I still have no registration, and endless hour of my time spent running to the treasures department for info they need again, fedexing random papers they need me to sign, and constantly having to call and try and get them to resolve this.

I did a trade-in online, the car was to be delivered on a Thursday. I had to update my license due to it being stolen. I went through the app and updated it and closed it out. Apparently, you have to go through the entire process again when you update anything. So, after 24 hours, my car that I thought I had purchased and was being delivered was released and sold to someone else. SO, I purchased a second vehicle. I was told it would be delivered Sunday, great. Saturday evening I get a text stating it had been rescheduled to Wednesday afternoon. Tuesday I get a text saying it will be delivered in the AM. In the am, the hub calls to say they are running behind and it will be an hour late. An hour later they call to say there is a car parked in front of it and they cannot find the key and are rescheduling to the afternoon. The afternoon rolls around and they call to say the car has been sent back to the WInder location and the only thing they can do is reschedule it but it has to be at least 2 days out so now I am looking at a Sunday delivery. I started this process almost 3 weeks ago and I still do not have a car. This has been the most frustrating process ever. I canceled a photography session this evening and am out over ****** due to this. The customer service line did nothing to try to make the situation better even though they are the ones who have messed up.

So guess what they do send you a pdf link go print your plates out?? ugh how tacky!

Dont believe them when they say this because I just received a $100 sorry for your troubles s***** check. Lets just start with the fact Aug I was in a head on collision and  car totaled out. So Carvana always  advertises this new fun fast way to purchase vehicles. So I did my research on the  vehicle  but clearly not  enough on Carvannas customer  service. So I got my check from the bank whose amazing btw love Navy Federal and theyve helped my credit tremendously, but I uploaded all the documents so my side of the deal was done. I was excited.

I had three different cars from Carvana and there was something wrong with each one of them. I received the first car on 10/21/21. I was purchasing a ******* Elantra but after inspection of the vehicle, I noticed the trunk of the car said Sonata. No one from Carvana customer service was able to verify what type of car it actually was. Their recommendation was for me to take the car to a ******* dealership for them to verify which it actually was. Then they wanted me for pay for the trunk to be replaced and be reimbursed. I declined and opted to just exchange.I got another Elantra and after 2 days when I was on the freeway the car began to shake violently and the check engine light came on. I should have taken this as a sign to just leave them alone but unfortunately I didnt and exchange the second bad car for another one. This time I got a ****** Corolla and after driving the car for two days the check engine light comes on. I call them again and Im told to take the car to a preferred repair shop and have a diagnostic run. That came back showing that the car needed over $2000 in repairs. Im returning the third car and Im going to get a car elsewhere. I would never do business with Carvana again.

Its like they are just buying any used car they can find and reselling them without any time of inspections or quality checks. This was really the worst experience.",no response,No response

They went out of their way to improperly abbreviate the name of my bank and another bank, with a different long name, is the address they chose to use for the $500 referral check. About two months after my purchase and after multiple phone calls this error was discovered and a new check issue and the error 'fixed'. HA! Nope, when they sent the registration packet to the *****************, they decided to continue to use the correct bank name and totally incorrect bank address. They went so far as to scratch through the correct bank address on the TIL and replace it with the address they found on ****** apparently, which is, again, to the wrong bank. I am now having to continually call and ask my actual lender to not increase my interest rate due to not receiving the title all the while playing whack a mole with figuring out between the state DMV, actual lender and Carvana how to correct the title and who has to do it-the only thing I know is I cannot. Carvana needs to properly train and hire detail oriented people to ensure mistakes do not happen because 'correcting' later is not easy, is time consuming and frustrating.

Once the car was avail it seemed to have what I was looking for Carvana only showed 3 paint chips so I ordered the car. The delivery the day before the car was supposed to be delivered I get a text that morning reminding me of the next day delivery and time later that evening I get a call saying they will miss delivery date and time promised I had made special arrangements to get my car they best they could do was almost a week later I was promised a refund of $25. A day I come back to that part soon. So the next issue I noticed past there 7 day return policy a lot more road chips and nicks including the windshield they wont replace the windshield even throw there a 100 day warranty. I was told by Carvana they would replace it but the company they use to run there warranty service told me no. Next issue I was told when I bought the car that they would have to send me the stuff needed to register my car since I live in a state they cant do it and was told I would be sent a refund for the money they changed for registration and I would get that check when the paperwork came in. Fast forward three weeks I called to find out where the package was for registration I was told they where working on it and they would notify me of a tracking # two days later Fed Ex attempted to deliver a package I had no idea was even on the way. So after a few more days I finally worked it out to get the package when I open it there everything I need to register my car except the check for the money they where paid to do so. The letter in the package told me to get my car registration asap so I called Carvana for what has felt like the 100th time and was once again told sorry we made a mistake and the check for late delivery and should be mailed soon. So Carvana has taken money for registration except me to pay again on a pro Use the checks in the mail. So they are also getting interest on the money they charged for registration because its part of the cost of the car since I financed which should not be allowed.

1890,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,11/08/2021,"I cannot leave a poor enough review to explain the DISASTER that is a car purchase with Carvana. Every step of the way I had to jump through hoops. All of their ads make everything seem so simple so I decided to give it a chance. First, you get 3 days to hold the car from the minute you start the purchase. Not 3 business days, 3 days. Which they don't tell you until after you've done it. Not super helpful when you unknowingly buy the car at 8pm on a Friday night.  When uploading funds you have to direct link your bank which I tried to do. Not compatible. Ok, so they want you to do a 3 way call with Carvana and the bank, not compatible. Ok, so they will accept a scan of a cashiers check to prove you got the funds. No problem took care of that, should be good to go, right? Nope. Every person you talk to after that asks you why your bank isn't linked so you tell them and they then offer the 3 way call. You will literally have to explain you've paid OVER AND OVER. They are also not compatible with MA registry but they give no indication of that on their site. This results in a 2 ish day battle back and forth between Carvana and your car insurance company. During which time Carvana will insist your car insurance is just bad and you should get a new company. Want a quote? They've got some for you! Totally not a scam there. I cant roll my eyes hard enough. Each representative you speak to will offer to walk you through what to expect at delivery ( to pass the time while they look into why nothing will work for you) . Each of these people will then give you a different run down of what will be happening. Delivery day arrived and I got a call that things were ahead of schedule and they can come early. I was ecstatic! Only to get a call 1 hour later saying they aren't coming. Their deliver truck has a check engine light so I got to drive 90 minutes each way to go get it or Id have to reschedule for another day next week. UNBELIEVABLE! I drove all the way out there and I will say the onsite representative was very kind, apologetic, and helpful. This was 1 out of dozens of reps I spoke with though..... I was not able to test drive the car outside of the tiny parking lot because it didn't have any plates. This I found especially odd since that was the one common thing everyone I spoke to said I would absolutely get to do. At this point I had earned this car, I was not walking away after all of this garbage. They only gave me one key and told me not to worry silver rock was going to take care of this. So I wait and get an email on Monday and immediately look into this. The list of possible places to get this taken care of consisted of about 11 places. The first 10 don't deal with keys.... One said I wanted to make the over 45 minute drive out there they MIGHT be able to help. So I try the dealership as they said that was the last resort option. AGAIN no one can help with this. Silver rock wants the dealer to call them with the quote. The dealer says no silver rock has to call the dealer. So I try calling silver rock to request this and they say no they cant. The suggest I just go buy a key and wait for reimbursement from them. If this had been the only issue no problem. But it wasn't the only issue. Every step of the way Carvana is completely unhelpful even making it feel as though they are intentionally making things harder all the while offering fake apologies and reassuring you this is all so simple.

I purchased this car because my family and I were in dire need of a vehicle, and according to Carvanas website this vehicle was available and ready to be delivered within a few days of purchase.  I quickly went through the process quickly and bought the car online.  Everything seemed fine, all the forms were signed and documents uploaded, my car was scheduled to be delivered to me within a couple days.  They sent me messages saying the car was on schedule and I could look forward to my car soon.  I believe it was less than 24 hours before my car was to be delivered, I got a message from Carvana telling me there was a problem and I needed to call and reschedule my cars pick up appointment.  So needless to say I called right away.  At this point myself, my husband and son all needed to take Lyft rides to work and school while we thought we only needed to wait 3 days for our new car.  Once I called Carvana the gentleman I spoke to ( he was great and did the right thing btw and Carvana if you see this he is the only thing that saved your company from getting sued right away).  told me that something happened to my car during transport and it had to go into the shop.  He said to me the soonest that I could get my car was 10 days from then!  I freaked out and told him our situation and said there was no way I could wait that long, that we couldnt afford to take Lyft rides everywhere!  He tried his best and told me that If I got a rental car, Carvana would reimburse me for the inconvenience.  I asked him if he was sure, he said yes to rent the vehicle and send Carvana the receipt.  I then went and rented a car for the remainder of my wait for the car I purchased.  A couple days after I had rented the vehicle my gut told me to call Carvana and make sure it was noted in my account about the rental reimbursement.  The next representative I spoke to told me there was nothing in my account saying this, that there was only a reimbursement approved for $250.  I told the lady what happened and she told me she would look into it with management.  A long drawn out heart wrenching horrible experience later a member of management approved my rental.  10 days later I got my car returned the rental and sent the invoice to Carvana.  The car wasnt worked on at all, the battery was bad and a week after purchase died and my husband And I have to jump it every time we need to go somewhere and the same time the oil and fluid maintenance light came on.  I would think when you overpay by thousands for a car that the company could at the very least complete an oil change on the vehicle?!  So then I get the overnight delivery from Carvana.  I open it expecting the check to be for the exact amount of my rental. Nope it was $400 short.  I call again and was told $750 was all that I could be approved for, when in fact management told me it would ALL be covered.  Mind you Carvana states on every call that you are recorded so shame on you all for lying to customers so much. So I talk to the member of management working my case and ask were the rest of my reimbursement is.

1898,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,11/06/2021,"Where do I start. When I got the 1st car, had the worst experience. The car was dirty, inside and out. Bluetooth was not connecting , the touch screen wasn't working. On top of that the car started shaking. I have pictures to proof.I called the same day to get the 2nd car, the experience was much better. But then the carvana person stated there was scratches that wasn't mentioned in the Ad, they would paid for it. But now I need to rent a car for 2 weeks and they said they would need to reimburse me for renting a car and even then I need to wait for me to get approved for the reimbursement. Ridiculous this is my fault the car had scratches carvana didnt mentioned. Now 5 months in with the 2nd car my car is shaking, the transmission seems to be slipping and there's a noise when you turn the wheel, took it to the mechanic that Silverrock approved and got told that Silverrock won't cover it, mechanic told me that the car needed a transmission flush, throttle body cleaning,  Filter change and that the transmission was so dirty from a 7 out of 10. That it should have been changed after 60k I bought the car around 65k, meaning their 150 point inspection wasn't done correctly this should have been part of it. Carvana does a 150 point inspection that they change the oil but don't check the other fluids, so I suggested to anyone that as soon as you are interested in the car take it to a mechanic to have everything checked. I feel like at this point carvana should refund me the money I had to spend to get the car fixed, there's no way the car passed a 150 point inspection with the way the transmission fluid was looking, due to the transmission fluid being so dirty that the transmission could go out being low miles and carvana should have looked into this.

1903,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,11/05/2021,"The entire process from inception to completion was horrendous. This is my second purchase with Carvana and it did NOT go as seamless as the first purchase. On 6 Oct 21, I picked out my first vehicle  a 2013 Land Rover Ranger Rover Sport (supercharged) and was to have it delivered on 9 Oct 21. On the day of delivery, no less, I was told the vehicle cannot be delivered because of a failed inspection item (trunk door broken) - despite the 150-point inspection that was claimed to have been done prior. On the follow-on delivery date, again I was called and told yet another missed inspection item (parking sensors failed) was caught then and so the delivery would be pushed even further out. A few minutes later, I received another call recommending that the vehicle not be delivered altogether and for me to choose a different vehicle. By this time, I had switched insurance from the vehicle I was going to trade in, to the 'purchased' vehicle as Carvana requires proof of insurance on all purchased vehicles prior to delivery. So, since the vehicle was not delivered as planned, I had to call and have the insurance switched back to my regular vehicle that I was using toward the trade-in. I then disappointingly & reluctantly returned to the Carvana website to choose another vehicle, which this time I found a hybrid *** X5 on 15 Oct 21 and when I went to secure the vehicle, much to my chagrin a message popped up stating that I cannot purchase TWO vehicles. This took me aback and upon further investigation, realized that I was NOT released from the Land Rover purchase even though it was a recommended cancelation from Carvana's end. By the time I was finally released, I missed out on purchasing the *** X5 I wanted. My third attempt reluctantly took place shortly thereafter and I managed to find a 2014 ************* GLK 350 which was to be delivered 23 Oct 21. Upon delivery, I realized that the under-car shield/engine splash guard was badly damaged  missing screws, cracked straight down the middle, and loosely and lowly hanging, which precluded test-driving the vehicle. I immediately notified the delivery guy (****), and we all took pictures of said damage just moments after it was taken off the flatbed. This started yet another not-so-customer friendly and very lengthy and totally inconvenient process that included the vehicle being parked in my garage from 23 Oct 21 (date of delivery from Carvana) to 27 Oct where it was then towed to a recommended ************* dealership to have the under-car shield replaced - or so I thought. Again, much to my chagrin - *********** (limited warranty provider) initially DENIED my claim to assume the cost of the repair. At this point, I have not had the chance to 'test drive' or even enjoy my purchase so I had to ask for an extension on Carvana's 7-day return policy, while I went back and forth with ***********, ***************************, and Carvana representatives to get the matter resolved. It finally was 'conveniently' agreed upon 29 Oct 21 (last day to return the vehicle). The vehicle was finally fixed and returned to me on 2 Nov 21 late evening, but not without towing issues. The first towing company that went to retrieve the vehicle from *************************** claimed a lengthy wait and left without letting me or anyone else for that matter know. Three hours into a delivery that was initially estimated to take ******* minutes, I called and was rudely told that the driver waited, and no one showed so he left. I had to again arrange for another towing service via Carvana's 'roadside assistance service' to go get my vehicle and somehow TWO tow companies were dispatched but neither picked up the vehicle and so I had a scare as I had NO contact information for the person who'd actually picked up my vehicle and as I was reporting it to the cops, the tow truck driver called and said *********** dispatched him. This lack of communication reflects very bad business practices, and the entire experience has left a very bad taste in my mouth. Just yesterday I was contacted by Bridgecrest (Carvana's financial institution) requesting payment on my previous car loan that has not yet been settled. It just seems like there is no foreseeable end to the surmounting troubles I have been put through with Carvana. I will NEVER return, nor will I recommend anyone either as this entire experience was abysmal and unconscionable and I would not wish this not even on my worst enemy. Shame on you! Recommend Carvana conducts REAL, GENUINE & THOROUGH inspections PRIOR to deliveries to avoid further class action suits or legal ramifications. Apply the 'golden rule' ALWAYS and put yourselves in the positions of your customers then maybe this would become a business worthy of customers' loyalties and return/referred businesses. Wow!! Very bad business.",no response,No response

Prior to arrival I was notified that the car only had minor scratches and blemishes. When the vehicle arrive the bumper was barely hanging on. The driver alerted me that this was no issue that they have a third party company (Silverrock) that they run all their repairs through. I didnt think too much of it and was going to trust the process. I made contact with silverrock they gave me a list of their approved body shops. I made the appointment, got the work done, and picked up my car. The bumper was painted the wrong color. There was ***** contrast between the bumper and the rest of the car. Body shop guy said sorry thats the best we can do. I contacted Silverrock, they stated I had to make an attempt to have it repaired again by the same body shop. I had to explain to them that the shop said they would not repaint it. Finally approved for me to take it to a body shop of my choice. I took it to a highly rated body shop. The gentlemen told me, No problem, we can fix this. I went through the necessary steps laid out by silverrock to have the repair done there. Made my appointment with the body shop which was about 5 weeks out. 1 week before my appointment the body shop called and said silverrock disapproved the repair. Their reason was because the shop wasnt in the approved network I explained to the silverrock rep that I already had permission to go outside the network. After much arguing and several phone calls I got reapproved for the second time to take the car to the body shop. I went through all the necessary steps once again to make an appointment.Meanwhile 2.)At the beginning of the purchase I was told by Carvana staff that the title would take 4-6 weeks to be mailed to me. I explained to them that I needed the title quicker in order to meet a deadline from my bank in order to take advantage of an auto loan promotion. Carvana explained to me that if I paid cash for the vehicle that would speed up the process. So I did. I spent all $21,889.73 of my savings on that car. I followed steps on the dashboard for necessary paperwork. I made a trip to the busy *** to obtain a VIN Affidavit. I mailed the paper work. Waited two weeks, never heard a word. I called Carvana to see what the problem was, they stated they never received the paper work. I made a second trip for the affidavit, mailed it and waited AGAIN. Two weeks goes by same story, never hear a word. I call Carvana and they stated the *** person filled out the paper work wrong. I made a third trip mailed it, FINALLY they received it correctly. Its 10/7/2021 TWO months later. After a week goes by Carvana reaches out to me and stated that THEY LOST paper work on their end and I need to go get a limited power of attorney notarized. So I did. Two weeks goes by and BAMMMMM I get T-boned at an intersection. My car is totaled. Once the car is totaled by an insurance adjuster they will only give you a rental car for 1 week. And the insurance company wont give you the money for your car until you give them the title.

It's now August (six, almost seven months later), I've gone through five temporary operating plates, and they JUST NOW decided to tell me, after about fifty phone calls trying to figure out what the issue was, that the reason its taking so long to receive my plates and registration is because they LOST the title to the vehicle that I bought and have no idea where it's at. They literally told me every single time that I called, which was once every couple weeks, that it wasn't anything on their end and that it was the **** When I called the *** they said that it was Carvana.

They told me that they filed for a duplicate title but are unsure of how long it will take. I asked them if they could just take the car back because technically theres no proof anywhere that the car is mine if they don't have the title and they said that I could ""sell it back to them"". Uhmmmm wouldn't I have to have the title to sell it back to you? Thank God the loan company can send me my memorandum in a few days and I can try to go to the *** to get my plates and registration myself.

It appears that there are a large amount of positive reviews, one would assume that this is because many transactions have worked out well. If you really peel back some layers of the onion youll find a large disparity between the ratio of positive to negative reviews on the Carvana site and those on other sites. As a customer I havent been offered to a shot at review. I would assume many others are not either and are forced to review on other sites such as this. My experience;3 months of waiting to purchase after placing a deposit. 3 months later I still have no answers other than it can take ***** business days for a vehicle to be available. 20+ calls with no information other than the vehicle will be inspected soon, yet from day one on the site the vehicle is inspected with detailed notes of small imperfections. 6 calls requesting supervisors to call back, 6 promises that I will receive a call from a supervisor and that the information does not add up. 6 more empty promises without a single follow up. No information is available, the location of the vehicle may not even be known and it sounds like this is a regular issue for Carvana. It makes one wonder if the marketing carries so much more weight than the delivery and can carry the organization through for years or if this is simply an issue that has been masked by the remote nature of the pandemic. The failure to empower customer service with real information,  disorganization of inventory, transportation logistics and stagnant initial and after sale transactions will show in time unless the organization listens to the thousands of poor transactions that are really occurring.",no response,No response

Youll pick another vehicle you dont like as much and have your credit ran again without your knowledge and they wont deliver that one on time either.  Then theyll offer you a minuscule check after your 7day back guarantee which is a fraction of what you had to pay in rental cars due to their error. This company is complete BS.

I sat on the offer for a bit, then uploaded the needed documents. They then wanted me to set up an appointment. I waited a few more days and the day we purchased the new vehicle we set up an appointment for two days later with Carvana. Our Carvana advocate was ********* and she was great. Called me and told me if it was okay that she was 15 minutes early for the appointment and arrived right when she said she would. I gave her the keys and registration and she inspected the car and took it for a short test drive to make sure everything I put down was correct. About 15 minutes later she called me and told me she was ready. My husband and I signed the paperwork in less than 5 minutes, she processed the payment and I received a text and email that the funds would be in our account in 1-2 business days, depending on your bank. ********* said they would leave the car parked outside and a third-party truck would be by to pick it **. ** less than an hour, this all happened.

It is only after you attempt to exercise their policies do you realize the unnecessary hoops and hurdles you must navigate to do anything.The vehicle I received was grossly misrepresented. It was described as having two small imperfections (scuffs and scratches). The vehicle arrived with clear coat overspray, masking tape under the passenger door handle, misaligned headlights, and on the first drive on the highway, the skidplate beneath the car fell off and jammed under the car requiring a tow.After requesting a swap for a different vehicle, Carvana repeatedly cancelled the replacement car delivery and they would not return the payment to my bank. Carvana wanted to new check without returning the previous check, which my bank would not do, essentially financing two vehicles simultaneously.After I decided to cancel all business with Carvana, return the vehicle Carvana informed me it would take ***** days before they would come pick up the vehicle. During this time I am responsible for any possible damage to the vehicle (regardless of my fault, others or act of god) and have limited milage. This leaves me in a precarious situation where I do not want to drive the vehicle.After 10 days I checked with Carvana of the status of my return. The employee stated I would now have to wait ***** business days to schedule the return due to ""high volume of returns"".I am worries that Carvana will continue to push the goal posts further and further away and I will never be able to give back the car.

My car was delivered on time and the delivery process was seamless.  The problems were apparent immediately at drop off and in retrospect, I should have refused the car.   I think the problem was purchasing a vehicle that was offered from one of their preferred partners and Carvana had no idea what the condition of the car was.  The car was supposed to have been thoroughly inspected and cleaned due to COVID.  When I got in the car, it was clearly dirty with pieces of a cookie in the cupholder.  The plastic trim under the drivers seat was broken off. The delivery person took photos of the damage and submitted the claim for me.  I then had to figure out how to get the seat repaired since all of the shops on the warranty list did not do body work.  After a lot of back and forth with the warranty provider, I finally found a shop and had to take the car in twice, once for an estimate which had to be approved (even though the damage was noted up delivery) and again for the repair.  After fighting on the phone and via text for a full day, I was promised $150 to reimburse me for the dirty condition of the car.  I was told it could take up to 30 business days to get the check.  I followed up at 33 business day and learned that the check had not yet been approved.  On top of all of this, my car (purchased with ****** miles) also needs brakes, rotors and a new hatch latch.

By this time, I've already updated my insurance to **********, which they were aware of and definitely passed the **************************************** either ****** or **********.At this point in time, I request them to register my vehicle in **********. The first advocate put in the request and said to check back in a few days since it would need to be approved. I had to call twice and both advocates advised that I change my insurance back to ****** to finalize registering my car because if not, they would have to restart the whole process and do all new paperwork. I'm pretty sure that isn't even legal. Also at this point in time, my final operating plate has already expired after I requested a new one twice two weeks before it was set to expire. My HOA tows any vehicles that are not current in their tags/registration, so now I'm at risk of having my car towed. The last advocate also informed me that they weren't able to provide another operating plate and that I would have to travel 5 hours to a Nevada DMV to request a temporary operating plate while they still struggle to get my car registered. I've checked in with them today to see where they're at on my registration and they said they have submitted my paperwork for processing and that they can't provide me an ETA. I am currently about six months out from purchasing my vehicle and still have not received my plates and my bank has been telling me that they still haven't received the title yet from Carvana, but Carvana has informed me that they can't provide the title until 6-8 weeks post-registration, which has not even taken place yet. Absolutely disgusting how terrible (and probably illegal) this whole experience has been.",no response,No response
1954,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,10/25/2021,"I was very exited with the prospect of purchasing a car online with Carvana, they made the selection phase of the process seamless and were quick to follow-up. ***n came the delivery. I ordered a 2019 ****** Tundra after a thorough review of the vehicle and Carfax history report. *** photos were accurate but they failed to mention any undercarriage items such as rust. *** car was scheduled for delivery Oct. 22 which was inline with the estimate. On the 22nd the driver (private carrier) called me to inform me that he'd be a day late which was fine but he'd be unable to deliver do to a flat tire and asked me to meet him in a ******* parking lot. Of course I obliged because who doesn't get excited at the prospect of a reasonably priced $47k 2019 Tundra Sport! Upon arrival at ******* the truck was loaded rear facing front with the tailgate into the wind and at the top of the trailer behind another vehicle. Coming into the lot my son said ""Dad you really went all out!"" Unfortunately this was a case of looks good from 50 feet away. Upon closer inspection the entire underbelly and suspension of the truck was covered with rust. *** connecting bolts on critical components like upper control arms and brake calipers were severely rusted it actually looked like it was parked in a foot of salt water for a few months. Next I looked up at the truck and noticed the rear window was open. I told the driver who had just driven **** miles from Ohio about it and he looked shocked. Mind you this vehicle was parked backwards on the truck. That's when my son said ""uh dad the window isn't rolled down its completely shattered"" turns out he was correct. It was then I decided to refuse delivery and call Carvana. After a 45 minute hold listening to ""your estimated wait time is less than 5 minutes"" I was connected to ""****"" in the main call center. I told him the story and he said it was absolutely appropriate to refuse delivery so I did. I went home with my tail between my legs feeling defeated and sad at the fact that Carvana had already debited $4000 from my checking account and I  had no way of getting it back quickly. Upon returning home I was contacted by ""*****"" from the customer advocate team. ***** asked me to take delivery of the vehicle even though it was opposite to the advice offered by the call center and told me ""on a recorded line"" the vehicle would most likely be picked up in 1-2 days. Because the driver was a private carrier I felt bad because having refused delivery as I'd of kept him from earning a living  and his trailer only held 2 vehicles. So, I took delivery having the driver drop it in a field I own next to my house. As of today Oct. 25  Carvana has made no effort to reach out. I called and spoke to an advocate again and he informed me they had no driver scheduled to pick up the truck. So there it sits in my side yard without a rear window under an atmospheric river raining over 3 inches in just the past 24hours with rain and snow to come. Carvana has not offered any sort of remedy, and they've offered nothing in return for my ""storing"" their vehicle in my yard. As a software architect I can almost guess where they're systems are failing to accommodate a vehicle return especially one with damage and getting more damaged by the minute. Given the call center's ""best estimate"" they will have a driver assigned to pick it up Oct. 29th and by that time I estimate the truck will be declared a total loss due to flooding. I have no words for Carvana's utter failure in this transaction other than I think they're victims of their own success and have become what they claim not to be; just another auto dealership who puts profit over customer experience. I've shared all this information with my local dealer here in ******* ** ""*********************"" they said this is not uncommon especially with rural deliveries and offered to price match the Tundra with an identical model and 8K fewer miles. *** moral of the story here is there are no unicorns to be found in this market so shop locally and unless all things fall into place according to Carvanna's carefully planned, terribly excuted workflow you stand a strong chance of having to store a lemon and have your money tied up for who knows how long. Sadly I'd have to recommend any buyer beware and if you do decide to purchase Carvana I'd recommend you only do it from a ""vending machine"" or from a local market so you don't cost a private carrier his or her living by refusing delivery.",no response,No response

It took me 3 days to get in contact with them. 3 days. Absolutely insane. Probably spent a total of 4 hours on hold. Then made me feel like I was the one in the wrong, dancing around my question of why my appraisal changed, instead badgering me about signing online documents with numbers I didn't originally agree on. All while I had emails from them with the correct numbers, and they just made excuses as to why they weren't valid.

Earliest available delivery time is now on 10/18 - more than 2 weeks later. A representative promises that they will find a way to squeeze me in earlier - they will call me to let me know in a day or two. Of course nobody calls me, so I just make peace with the idea of scheduling delivery on 10/18.

The day before, I get another delay notice.Things happen - I understand that. The fundamental issue here is transparency. Carvana has been lying straight to my face for a month now.

I get a call just before delivery stating the car was delayed due to a piece in the interior being busted. They took it to the dealer here in town and they had the part so the delivery was pushed back to Saturday. Not great as I had taken pto thurs and fri to drive the car around and have some fun. So I rescheduled my pto for the next week and waited for Saturday. Friday I get a call stating that my new wait time was now three months. Three. Months. What? Isn't there an inspection process? Why weren't all these issues the dealer found found by the inspection team? What a great question, I have never gotten a real answer there. So I cancel that order and Pre-order another vehicle. After waiting a week or so for it to get out of the inspection process it becomes marked as unavailable. Perfect. In the mean time they have relisted the car I originally purchased that needed three months of work?!?!?! The advocate I spoke to said that it was at one of their inspection hubs in Ohio and that it was probably taken there so Carvana could do the repairs themselves. Okay I said, the original car showed a date of being delivered the following week so it must be fixed so I reordered that car. The problem now is that because I had to go through financing again and the original hard pull dropped my credit I now had a higher interest rate on the car that I originally ordered. I asked them if they could honor the original terms and they said no. They were unwilling to honor their original terms for a mess that their horrible inventory issues caused.

Started my purchase on 10/1/21 on the website I was told I could have it delivered in three days. I went ahead and scheduled it for another week out to make sure I had time off for my delivery and a couple days after that to check out the car. The day before my appointment came and I recieved a text that my delivery was still on schedule. The next day the driver text me a couple hours before to have me send him a picture of my driver's license with my face next to it. I also sent him my updated insurance cards. I then had another document to sign online before the delivery. After all that was said and done I waited around for another two hours before the driver called me and told me he was on the way. His name was Will and he was a stand up guy. He arrived 30 mins early and I was okay with that because he let me know ahead of time. When he arrived it was a very easy process and Will (Delivery Driver) was a very professional and friendly employee for a delivery driver. The car arrived on the flatbed trucks you see in the commercials. He unloaded the car and let me take a look at it. I then gave him the keys for my car in exchange for the new car keys. I then test drove the car and he did the same with mine and checked it out to make sure the trade in was good as stated. I came back after the test drive and talked to Will about mustangs because that's what car I purchased. He then showed me a family car that him and his relatives own which is a **** Mustang GT350. We then talked about the delivery and everything was squared away. I signed a couple more documents and then the whole process was over. I noticed some paint was missing on the back bumper and this was not shown in the pictures. I went online and made a claim through my dash board and 24hrs later they sent me a shop to take the car to and get the paint fixed. Other than that the car Is in great shape and the whole process has been smooth. I will update this post once I recieve my new tag!

I have had a very good experience buying my car from Carvana, and I don't think I will ever purchase a used car from a car salesman ever again.  I was looking for a nice looking commuter vehicle with some get-up-and-go and I found it in my Audi A4.  Amazing vehicle that is comfortable and elegant, yet drives like a sports car.  Very fun to drive!Carvana was pretty accurate in their description of the vehicle I purchased.  They listed an interior imperfection/scratches, but I have yet to see any; the interior is immaculate and awesome condition.  They listed 3 areas on exterior issues labeled ""minor scratches/swirls"", and I easily buffed and polished the car and the paint looks very good.  The car arrived exactly how I expected a used vehicle with ****** miles to look.  It came with 2 key fobs with one of them having a weak battery, but the delivery driver put in for a battery replacement using the Carvana **************** and I will update you if I have any issues dealing with them.  All electrical and mechanical functions of the vehicle have cleared and I don't anticipate any issues with the car whatsoever and I will update you if there are any.I financed through my bank and it was a very simple process.  My only gripe is the 3rd party ******* ******* that Carvana uses to verify the down payment required security information, and I did not like giving anyone that information.  Other than that, the process from beginning to end was effortless and without any wrinkles or curveballs.  The vehicle was delivered on the scheduled date and time by a nice and professional lady who was patient with our questions, the registration was completed within 2 weeks in my state, and I am the owner of an amazing luxury sports sedan that I have been dreaming about for a couple years.If I am ever in the market for a used vehicle again, I will not hesitate to look at Carvana first and purchase a vehicle through their ******* if they have the car I want.  Perhaps an upgrade to the Audi A6 :)  I have read others reviews before and after purchasing and I did not experience any of their issues.  I am realistic and understand a used car is not a new car, I can detail the car and make it look amazing, and the delivery and registration was exceptional.  I wish I was allowed to acknowledge the Carvana reps I dealt with and complement them personally to the Carvana Corporate folks, because their employees were fantastic; these reps deserve praise from their supervisors.  I work in customer service and these people were great!",no response,No response

A $30k purchase, multiple delays in delivery, then 3 months behind on registration, plays constant games to protect themselves legally and use a power of attorney in their own interest. The worst customer service I could have ever imagined given their line of business and responsibilities completing the purchase paperwork.This company would receive 0/5 if possible.

Also since the rear defroster can not be fixed they had to replace my back windshield, making me not have tint in the back window anymore...oh carvana doesn't deal with tinting or removeable items? well then why did a claim get submitted and accepted by silverrock because of peeling tint from the rear passenger door the day i received it? also it doesn't seem to me that carvana is going to work quickly to get me my tag and registration. i told the lady i need it by november the 1st or i'll risk getting a ticket....but either they don't understand or they don't seem to care",no response,No response

I jumped through all their hoops, which was a challenge for me due to using online technology. I was purchasing with cash , gave then access to my bank account . I did every thing they asked and had to deal with their ticking clock countdown for delivery with messages stating , if you want it delivered faster do tis or that, I did it all ! I felt like a hamster in the wheel, but I did it. At my age looking for rides to work is hard on me , so I jumped for Carvana. Well, I was suppose to get my Lexus ES 350 today , 10-12-2021 at 3:00 pm. I planned for this delivery. Scheduled a mechanics appt., planned a trip to help my 89 yr. old Aunt. , took a weeks vacation. Day before Carvana sent a text at 8 am, we are on schedule for your delivery. At 3:30 pm they sent another text, "" we hit a speed bump, your new delivery date is, OCT 18th."" The lexus was only 4-1/2  hours away in N.C. basically down the road from me, and yet without any explanation or the decency of a phone call, they changed the delivery date by a week.

Trying to make the actual purchase, register the vehicle, and get the title....Total nightmare.  Their customer service is awful I traded my vehicle and had the new one delivered.  I didn't like the vehicle after a day and canceled the order requesting a new vehicle.  They called to tell me the new vehicle would be delayed over a **** due to the Hurricane.  At that time, I elected to stay with my original vehicle as I had more time to get used to it and found that I actually did enjoy the vehicle.  It was at this point that I requested to pay off the vehicle and have the title sent directly to me. They stated that they could not do that at this time as the sale would need to be rebuilt and that I should reach back out to them in a couple of ****s for a update.I reached out to them again 9 days prior to my temp tags expiring.  They could not provide me a update and said they would need to send new tags.  I again requested to purchase the vehicle and was sent to their finance partner, Bridgecrest.  Bridgecrest stated that they didn't have anything on me and returned me to Carvana who could not provide me with any information or updates.I reached out again to Carvana 3 days after my tags expired as I still had not received new tags or been able to put the plates (transferring) on the vehicle.  I again requested to payoff the vehicle and again I was sent over to Bridgecrest.  Bridgecrest flatly stated that they had zero information on me and could not help **** reached out to Carvana again because the tags were expired.  They could not register the vehicle for temporary tags in my state so their solution was to email me a PDF of an ******* temp tag. (I was recently pulled over regarding this though the officer was very understanding and let me go.  I went to the *** and not even they could definitively say whether or not I could operate the vehicle like this.)I have had enough of the entire situation and resigned myself to purchasing a new vehicle through an actually dealership and let them duke it out with each other over the title.  After spending a considerable amount of time and picking out a new vehicle, I still could not find a resolution as Carvana refused to give the payoff to the dealer as well.They escalated me to a gentleman by the name of **** somewhere in the post sales department or whatever they called it.  He could not give me a solid answer as to why they would not give the payoff for the vehicle or why the resale build was going to take as long as it was.  My final resolution at this point, ***** days after purchase was for Carvana to take the vehicle back and give me the $15,200 from my trade-in.A **** later I was told that this request was denied and that my resolution was to basically sit and wait for Carvana to figure it out and get it sorted.  Their other customer service tactic was to blame me for my initial indecision and then blame their current volume without giving me any sort of definitive timeline other than the 2-3 months I have been consistently quoted throughout the entire process.I made one last attempt to seek a resolution and basically told them that I would be going legal if necessary and their response was to send me the address to their legal team.

She said there was nothing she could do, and said she warned me this would happen. She screwed up and tried to make it seem it was my fault.

I spoke to someone in customer service who said the car was in NC and I love in IL.  I asked if I could cancel and choose a different car and was told yes.

You get the run around A LOT, from only 24 hrs to work with a bank to get buy out info, to if you aren't a policy holder and only a insured driver on insurance its a no go. Delivery went fine beside the driver being 2 hours late. They kept giving the run around about documents being missing, when all were submitted more than 3 times. Half of the documents I was told I needed for the driver, he didn't glance at. I was only given 15 mins with the car before the delivery guy left. The car was delivered with dust lining everything, but runs great!

I totaled my car, and with current deliveries of new cars, decided to purchase a used car to expedite the process. I found a car through Carvana, selected a delivery date (7 days from start of process), and uploaded all of the required documentation, including a Certified Check for the full purchase price. At this point, I was truly impressed with the company and efficiency. I travel for business, and have a demanding schedule, but scheduled a flight to pick up my car on the day specified. While flying home to pick up the car at my home ( they deliver), I received an email re-scheduling ( 10 days from start of process) into the future. Obviously, I was disappointed, but understood that delays do occur. I contacted them, received apologies and guarantees on redelivery and changed my schedule accordingly.The day before delivery, I received another email stating that the documentation required was not satisfactory. Apparently, they could not verify the check without me on the phone. Of course, nowhere did they ever state that they needed my help in validating the check, nor did they try to call. Another phone call, more apologies, and the car was rescheduled ( 17 days after start of process). Canceled flights, booked new flights and got ready for my new delivery date. What was odd, was that ended up being able to verify it after all without my help.The day before re-re-delivery, again another email canceling delivery due to inadequate documentation. This time, my license, which was due a full three weeks after the new delivery was inadequate. An internal policy at Carvana dictated the license needed to be valid for ate least 45 days after delivery. No phone calls, texts, or emails from them explaining the issue before it a problem. Just, cancelation. Another phone call, apologies, uploading my renewed license, new delivery date (22 days after start of process). More flight cancelations, rebooking, etc.....Guess what happened the day before re-re-re-delivery? That's right, another email rescheduling to 4 days into the future. This is after confirming via phone call earlier in the day. I haven't yet reached out to them yet, as I'm not sure anything they tell me could have any validity, but have shopped an purchase a car from another local dealership within 2 hours of landing.The future appears to be in ecommerce, but process, and personnel issues seem to be plaguing this company. Unlike many, I tend to have a very long memory regarding companies which seem to lack in process and/or competent personnel. As I have dealt with many people at Carvana, and the chances of all of them being incompetent is very low, I can only conclude, the company's processes are flawed.

On August 5th, I traded in my 2012 ******* Veloster for a 2017 ****** Crosstrek at Carvana ************. 2 weeks later, on Thursday August 26, I was driving on the highway when suddenly the car felt funny. I thought it was a flat but then the engine lost power, oil light flashed on the dash, followed by a flashing check engine light. I pulled over immediately and as soon as I stopped the car, the engine died. That is when my nightmare started. I had tow my car home cause it was late at night and nothing was open (even the SilverRock, Carvana's warranty company and could not get road side assistance!) The next day, I had the car towed to a SilverRock approved repair facility, PepBoys. Pepboys rejected the car cause they could not repair it, they informed me the car needed a new engine. I then had the car towed AGAIN - paying out of pocket - to a local ****** Dealership. The dealership talked to SilverRock to open a claim that took more than two weeks for an adjuster to come out and inspect the car. I was informed by the ****** dealership that SilverRock was going to source a JUNKYARD engine to be installed on my 2017 Crosstrek. When that junkyard engine arrived, the dealership rejected it on the spot because it was CRACKED on the front. They sent a damaged engine!!  But I was reassured on the phone by a SilverRock manager that ""they only use quality parts - - sure. I also attempted to swap my car for a different one because I need a vehicle asap and Carvana had me waiting almost a month to deny my claim because SilverRock is willing to pay for the repair...they will only pay for junkyard parts. And the cherry on top of all this is that Carvana will expect you to find and PAY for a rental and they will ONLY reimburse you UP TO $400. And good look finding a rental nowadays. I never found one.

After going back and forth about buying a car online, I finally settled and pulled the trigger on a *** 335i and anxiously awaited my week later delivery date. The car was used and advertised as 3 small dents/dings with pictures. All of the other pictures of the vehicle looked excellent condition. No other reported issues at all. The morning of the delivery, I get a call from the associate letting me know that no trucks are available, so they'll be driving the car to me and should be about an hour late. A little suspicious but ok, no big deal. They finally arrive, and not only was the car unwashed, (they advertise its meticulously cleaned and washed for delivery) the inside was filthy. The associate informs me that one of the key fobs doesn't work, but he's sure its just a battery and also that the kick plate on the driver door is loose and needs replacing which they'll handle. Dirt, debris, wrappers, sticky stuff on the seat headrest. There were several other scratches and dings to which I point out and they promise to have that fixed at no cost. I put down the convertible top and noticed the seals are all dry rotted and one section hanging off completely. ok, now I'm concerned. I start to really look around the car some more, and noticed the door panel wasn't nice and flush with the front corner panel and when opened, I find it is actually binding and scraping on the quarter panel. The quarter panel appears to have been a repair and does not line up with the door, the bumper or the hood properly like the other side does. The brakes are covered in rust and upon looking under the hood, I was able to find clear evidence of major body work on the front right. Engine looked nice and clean but that's the only positive. Long story short, I rejected the delivery, took back my vehicle and said nevermind. That same car is back up for sale the same day, again advertised in excellent condition and no damage.

Came to $1800.00 and have heard NOTHING from Silver Rock in three days.  Have contacted BOTH companys many times during ten days and got no explanations to satisfy me.  They were going to contact me on my 'last day' to make sure i loved the vehicle.  Heard nothing on the 7th nor 9th day so today i get a 'review Carvana' in e mail.  I dont love the vehicle because of this treatment and i do NOT LOVE CARVANA.  Will NEVER do business with them again and most certainly will NOT recommend them to one single soul.",no response,No response

My delivery was delayed multiple times which cost me because I bought car insurance starting the original delivery date. Then they said they would reimburse me. I have not received anything and its almost October. Then they said registration would be taken care of, paperwork submitted and paid for. The car was delivered with a temporary plate and I was to receive my actual plates within 2 weeks. No plates and temporary tag was about to expire. I called and they said to wait a couple days then call back. Nothing so I called and was promised an extension on the temporary tag. Had to call back quite a few times to know the status since I hadnt received the email or the document that was to be added to my dashboard on their website. After multiple calls I finally received the new tag and it was for Tenessee. I live in Georgia! They said it would be ok, that I can operate the vehicle. I still did not receive the Georgia plates so I called Carvana  again. They said registration is through a third party and they have no access to the information or any way to contact the third party to see what the issue was but it said processed in their notes. Then I called my local tag office. They said they received paperwork but Carvana never paid. I asked how much and it was $20. I figure fine Ill pay but the tag office hours of operation are during my work hours/closed on weekends and I wont make it on time unless I request time off from work. I am a teacher of small children and not able to just call out. Carvana said they would reimburse me the $20. So I felt alright with that even though they shouldve handled it originally as the process is supposed to be handled. Temp tag expires October 7,2021. I figured I should be able to get my official plates by then. Well today, September 27,2021,  I got pulled over on the way home from work because they saw the original temporary tag was expired but then I showed them the Tenessee temporary tag. They looked it up and it was not on file. It was fraudulent! Now I have a ticket and have a fine to pay for driving an unregistered vehicle even though Carvana set that tag up and said it was legit. I trusted them! I have called and spoken to 5 different people (I talked in a calm, professional manner because its not the current representatives fault, its whoever set up the tag and the third party registration personnel) and each call has gone blank!At the beginning of each call they state that they work from home because of Covid so if the call is dropped they will call right back. None did! I have been on hold on the phone waiting for another attempt to have them fix this mess. I tried the automatic call back system. I tried the texting route. And no help!

I purchased a ****** Tacoma in November 2020, along with the standard paperwork from the purchase there was a Carvana work order indicating that the front bumper had been repainted due to several chips that were repaired prior to my purchase. Everything appeared fine when I inspected the vehicle. Then 7 months later I noticed multiple blisters on the front bumper, over the next couple of days the more blisters on the paint appeared and the first round of blisters began to peel off exposing the primer. I took my vehicle to a ****** dealership and was told that it was a total paint failure due to poor workmanship, the tech informed me that the bumper had not been properly aligned as well as it not being the proper paint, and gave me an estimate of $3600 to repair. I contacted Carvana and was bounced around to their warranty companies which told me it wasn't covered due to it being cosmetic and to recontact Carvana. Carvana continued to tell me that it wasn't covered due to it being past their 100-day warranty. Between the ****** dealerships assessment and the only blisters/paint peel issue being where Carvana did the work, it's fairly apparent that it's poor work on their part which every customer service rep I spoke with admitted to. When I finally spoke with a manager I was told that they would not cover the cost nor do the paint job themselves since they are an online dealership and don't have a facility to do the repair. Instead, I was offered a mere $500 check and basically told I was, ""lucky they were giving me that much to cover the cost"".So fair warning to anyone looking to buy a vehicle through Carvana.

We took off work three times using vacation days and we were cancelled on each time hours before pickup time. We called and spoke to whoever answers the phone and they are actually very nice, poor people. They told both of us separately that someone from management would be contacting us and neither of us received a call still to this day. We finally got the car, the vending machine was broken, no bow on the car like we talked about, and the guy working just walked up to our daughter and handed her the token apologizing before we even had a chance to tell her it was her car. In the end, they offered us $200 discount after ruining $2000 worth of vacation days and destroying what should have been a priceless memory. Carvana is nothing more than big corporation and they could care less about everyday people. There upper level management is as bad and not caring as any company Ive ever used for anything. Do yourself a favor and go buy local from someone that will appreciate your business and time. Btw this is one of the only reviews Ive ever written.

Very difficult to ""chat"" with a human, and when one can finally get into a chat they don't try very hard to resolve problems. I was selling one vehicle to Carvana and buying a newer one. I was unable to sign the DocuSign documents to complete the purchase and was told on 3 different dates that my problem was being elevated as a top priority and I should try again in 48 hours. It was never resolved. I was finally advised that the problem was on ""my side"" and not a Carvana problem. I use DocuSign regularly and never experienced any problem until I tried with Carvana. In the end I was told to download the Carvana APP and complete the document there, which I did. On the evening of my scheduled delivery I was informed that my delivery was rescheduled 5 days later. I understand delays, but why was I not informed sooner? I have had the new car for a week now and I still keep getting texts and emails about accepting their offer on my used car (the one they picked up last week!!)

The warranty company told me since the car still has the manufacturers warranty that I needed to call a ******* dealer.

Definitely had some hiccups along the way that Caravan was able to resolve with little effort. I always had representatives answer the phone with little to no wait time. I experienced a delay in delivery that was due to a technical error on Carvana's side and after talking to the representatives I was told I'd be receiving a $250 check for the inconvenience which I can expect within 3-5 weeks from the end of my return period. Hopefully it arrives. Upon delivery the vehicle was as described with some minor cosmetic details that were not disclosed but nothing major. I experienced some small issues that Carvana has promised to fix with the warranty provided which I have an appointment for this week. Once again hoping for a good outcome. The trade in process went smoothly with no problems and I got much more than expected in trade in value.

They claimed the engine light was on because it sat too long. Then after the 7 day return the car started having a problem.

2151,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,2,09/23/2021,"I bought a 2020 Kia **** in July, 2021. It had approximately ***** miles on it and appeared to be in good shape.It arrived a few weeks late, but I was not upset and tried to be understanding. I had a quick inspection done by a mechanic (now wish I would have had a few different opinions) and nothing was mentioned of concern.Last week I noticed my front right tire was losing pressure pretty frequently and took it to Discount Tires, where I've gone for forever, basically.I bought complete and full coverage (as much as was offered anyway), I bought every warranty that was available and paid for the top ""carvana care"" that was available.Discount Tire stated that: 1) my tire had an ""air bubble"" and would need to be replaced.2) Something was ""fishy"" because it appeared my tires at ""AT LEAST"" ****** miles on them. I called Silver Rock to see what to do about this and they told me none of my issues would be covered. ""They won't be covered but you can call Assurance, if you want. They will not cover you but call them and they can explain why you won't get coverage.""So I called Assurance who said that my policy actually did cover the tire with the air bubble. Assurance was on the phone with Discount Tires, in front of me. For over an hour. Discount tires asking for a certain type of payment, Assurance stating that they would ""send a link to your email"".Discount Tires eventually gave up and told Assurance if they weren't willing to give what they were asking for, there was no transaction to be had.Once Discount Tires hung up, they told me there had been at least 5-6 other Carvana customers they had had the same issues with. And therefore would no longer be taking online payments in relation to Carvana. I would be putting miles on my car that weekend for work, and Discount Tires stated it wasn't safe to be driving on my tire, so they gave me a new ""cheap but safe for now"" tire.I spent tonssss of time on the phone that day with Silver Rock and then Carvana--- back and forth. Both kept saying I needed to call the other person.So I eventually requested a conference call and asked Carvana if I could call Silver Rock while I was on the phone with Carvana, since they continued to blame each other.Carvana told me that wasn't necessary and that they would call me on Wednesday at 2:00pm my time, with Silver Rock on the phone. I never once heard from anyone yesterday.Finally, after spending another couple hours on the phone with Carvana today. I was told they were too busy to call me for my appointment yesterday. ""Our work load has been very heavy.""I stated I would have appreciated a heads up in regards to that and I would have accepted a new appointment date and time.I was also told that since my tire issue wasn't noticed right away upon purchase, that they cannot help me with any of my issues.And since I do not have photos of my old tire with the air bubble, that one will not be covered or replaced as well.I am sad, as I was excited about Carvana. Discount Tire isn't in network with Carvana so I would have had to pay a ***** deductible which I had told all parties I was ok with paying, I just wanted to go through someone I trusted, and it was worth the *****. Now I have 4 tires that likely will not last long and will not be safe for the winter.I understand it's hard for them to know if I am being honest about my tires as the wear and tear was not noticed until I had had the car for a couple of months.But something doesn't sit right with me and definitely feels off. I also feel bad for Discount Tires.I'm referring to Discount Tires in ********, off of ********************, for reference.My mom has even planted the worry in my mind that maybe if the tires are showing than many miles that maybe someone messed with my odometer. Feeling highly anxious and worried about what other costs I could be acquiring. Will not recommend carvana to anyone, and will most likely not purchase again.

I would absolutely use them again. Just do your research and understand how Carvana works and what they guarantee and you will have a good experience. I would not recommend buying one of their cars with a delivery fee as this is non-refundable in any situation.

Haven't had the chance to try and contact silver rock either, few things like drive mode selector on the vehicle is loose, custom light in the grill that is illegal in my state to have while driving, etc. Overall the experience itself was fantastic.

I purchased a car which was listed on the Carvana website as AWD. First my delivery was delayed on the day it was supposed to be delivered without prior warning. Next my car was delivered with a nail in the tire and the tire sensors messed up which needed to be recalerbruated on my time. These are all problems I could live with. After a few days with the car I noticed that the car was a 2 wheel drive car. At first i was confused and thought I made a mistake, so i went back on the carvana website to double check. But no, the car was 100% listed as a AWD car. I called up carvana which they stated that I was correct and the car was listed wrong. After many calls they offered me $500 to keep the car or return it for another. Against my better judgement I found another car. It has taken carvana 5+ days to return the payment back to my finance company and they refuse to pick up the unwanted car from me until they drop off the new car. So no i am going on over 9 days with an uninsured/ unregistered car at my house that they refuse to pick up from me.

I purchased a car from them on May 21 and it has been 4 months and I still dont have the license plate. I purchased a car for my daughter a month after and her registration has arrived. I kept getting noticed for them trying to register the car that I traded in. It kept happening over and over again. Ive spent so many hours on the phone with them because of expired Temp tags and registration issues. I have military exemption for NV for around $2000 and they have yet to deduct it after I provided all the information to them over and over. The documents have to be less than a month old for NV DMV yet they have asked for updated document. Now my husband has bought me a mew vehicle and I want to trade this one in but cant because I dont have the registration. This us soooooooo exhausting and Im now overwhelmed. I couldnt drive the car for over 2 weeks because they kept saying theyd sent a new TOP but didnt. Im tired and want to stop having to contact them. I want what I paid for it and the DMV/taxes back,no response,No response

The following are a summary of my experiences and my final thoughts:I found the car I liked and set up my first drop-off. The car was delayed twice before finally being dropped off (3 weeks late). When the vehicle arrived, it was only charged 1/4 of the way to full (an electric car). I used the 7 day money back guarantee to test the car out and it simply didnt fit my lifestyle (no fault of Carvana). I called and set up the exchange with a better car that I felt would fit. The exchange process went well and the car was scheduled to swap out within the next few days. When the day arrived, the car was delayed another week and a half. Now I was stuck with a car that didnt fit my lifestyle and had to make it work. They made no effort to expedite the process for me (Im a return customer). The weekend before the next swap date, the car failed to start while I was at work. They had to call a towing company to pick up the car and now I was out of a vehicle entirely for another 3 days. When the next car got dropped off, the car was hardly detailed and had only 1/4 charge on the battery. The previous owner owned an animal and its fur was all over the seats. Im allergic to dogs and cats, so this was a real struggle to drive. On top of that, the charging cable that came with the car was very used and didnt look like the picture described. There was also a lot of extra interior damage that wasnt noted on the website. I was told that the warranty could work with me to fix the above items, so I decided to give the car a try. Some of the features that were advertised didnt work or the car didnt come with the option. This was frustrating, so I set up yet another swap (my last one). This next car had everything I wanted and more, so I was looking forward to getting it. The delivery was scheduled for 1 week. Fast forward 6 days later, of course the shipment was delayed yet again, so I was stuck with a swap vehicle for another 2 weeks. When I finally received the vehicle, it was not detailed well again and only had 1/4 battery charge (seeing a trend?)Theres a ton more extra that I havent included like: the 10s of hours total on the phone with Carvana at every one of their failure points to gain some resolution.I said I wouldnt add more of my feelings on the matter, but this needs to be said: This was easily the worst car buying experience Ive ever had and probably will ever have.

I did not visit a vending machine and did it via online/app search.  The marketing hype and so-called 150 pt inspection doesnt really mean that much significance to me; however the selection was better than via the local market even with a slightly higher cost. So far, I'm satisfied with my purchase so far as the car matched the description and the communication is definitely there (sometime too much).  Carvana was very good about maintaining communication, maybe a little over the top with useless text messages from their bot. I took away one star because of a paperwork s**** up. I signed the odometer disclosure upon delivery but then I get nagging texts about a problem and they need me to sign it again. The delivery guy was professional and ordered a new set of floor mats (still waiting g on them), filled the tank with gas, provided a check for better detail (still waiting for the check), and waiting for the registration.   mats, time will tell.

So I picked a  vehicle that was described as a black vehicle and submitted what I could as fast as I could. Keep in mind I owned a vehicle that was falling apart so I wanted to get something quick. Saw that it was supposed to be delivered September 2nd. A few days before it was supposed to be delivered it was delayed to the 6th. It wasn't a big deal then but I called and asked what was going on and all's I was told was it didn't get put on the car hauler to go to *********, ********. So then a few days before the 6th hit it was delayed again. Now I am starting to get upset. Called asked why it was being delayed I was told they lost the title and they have to get another title before they could release the vehicle. Long story short it was delayed again. The excuse that time was they didn't have to get a new title they had to wait for ************** to send them the title plates and registration and that the car would come with our registration and plates under my name on the vehicle. So I was thinking cool but why didn't they tell me the truth. So then it came to the 15 the day the delivery was set and ready to go. The truck pulled up and noticed the vehicle was ***** not black. My wife and I let that go. Took the car up and down the road it was good. Noticed there were stains on the head board which was in the description of the vehicle. Body looked great so didn't complain about it but there were stains probably from the mechanic that inspected and worked on my vehicle on the driver side visor. Let that go. I just needed a vehicle fast. So a few days after I received an email stating that the *** is going to be sending me my plates. I call ask for a tracking number. They told me to call on Saturday. Texted Saturday and basically was told there was no one that work at the *** on Saturdays. So I waited til Monday and texted and was told that they won't be able to call and get tracking, they don't make phone calls out. So basically, in a way, I was told lies to get me to stop calling. I don't know what happened with the color of the vehicle. I don't understand how they can tell people that they will have a vehicle by a specific date if it's not feasible. I don't understand why it's so hard to get a simple tracking number let alone to do business with carvana.

Few months and I decided to refinance through my credit union. When I called them I let them know I needed the official payoff so my bank can send them the check. Well, they sent it to me and I sent it to my credit union. Almost 2 weeks later I received a call from my CU, Bridgecrest sent the check back AND was charging me $114 of interest. The reason is because my bank did not put ""Bridgecrest"" on the name, instead put *************** which was the only name found on the payoff. Bridgecrest was no where on it. And instead of picking up the phone and letting me know so my bank could overnight the correct check, they sent it back via snail mail.Of course I am upset and called them about it. How am I supposed to know that the Payoff email that is for paying off the loan is NOT the correct info. When I say I am requesting this payoff to send to my bank so they can send you a check WHY would I think to ask ""Is this all the information I need to send to my bank so they can send you a check?"". I have paid off many many loans and I HAVE NEVER had this kind of problem with any of them. On top of that I am on my 5th follow-up phone call on this, and every time I get someone on the phone I have to FIGHT with them that I do not owe this $114. Once I finally do get to someone higher up they say they will call me back with follow-**** they never do. Every time I tell them that I want to talk to a supervisor or manager, they tell me to hold on, and the same person gets back on the line and tells me that they spoke with their ""cashiering team"" and that they are still working on this. I have never in my life dealt with such an incompetent company. This is $114. Now they are telling me that I am late on my September payment when they have already received the $26,000 check from my credit union and there should only be the $114 difference left. I am sure that I will end up paying this $114 to them for their mistake, but I will NEVER do business with this company or Carvana again because of it.   I actually really liked shopping with Carvana and planned on doing it in the future, but knowing that they are affiliated with this company has completely changed my mind. **Update- as I was talking they have told me they will not honor the payoff information and that they will need the $114.

2185,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,09/20/2021,I was extremely excited to buy my first car through Carvana because I heard so many great things about them BUT my experience with them did not have a happy ending. I decided to buy a 2016 Chevrolet Trax. The buying process went smooth and I was able to receive my car with in a week. Everything was going fine UNTIL my SECOND day of having my car. The transmission started making a weird rattling sounds whenever I tried to accelerate. This was strange because carvana ensured me the car had never been in any accidents and it only had ****** miles on it which is low for a used vehicle. They stand proud on each vehicle going through a 150 point inspection that the customer can be 100% confident in but I guess this inspection DOES NOT include the transmission. If you know anything about cars and their transmission once there is an issue its best to get a new car. A mechanic can tweak it so the issue doesnt appear for a few months to a year but it will eventually go out and replacing one is expensive. Once I understood the issue with my newly brought car I called Carvana to let them know I no longer wanted the vehicle. The customer service representative did nothing to help ease my mind about an issue caused by them. If I wanted to swap the car I would have to go through the whole car buying process with them again and would need to do that within the 7 days which isnt really 7 days its only 6 because the first day you receive your car counts as a full day no matter the time. After losing my trust in the company there was no way I could make a decision within 2 days before my 7 day money back was up. I ended up telling them to come get the vehicle back and getting my down payment back BUT they do not refund your delivery fee and the issue was no fault of mine.

Here are some of Carvana's strengths:*Fair-offer and hassle-free process for trading in my car.*Huge selection of vehicles to choose from *Loved shopping a from a huge and ever-renewing selection of cars from the comfort of my home and office.*Loved not having to deal with the drama and shiftiness of brick&mortar dealerships.*Fair price on the car I purchased.  *Delivery was prompt, on-time and pleasant.*I really liked Carvana's process of pointing out imperfections in the car when the car is listed.*A couple of extra issues emerged (one was caught by delivery person, the other by me, and it was pretty easy to get Carvana to agree to make the necessary repairs through the local ***** dealer.*Customer service staff is friendly, respectful, and pleasant.The only real gripe I have is with the relative impotence of customer service to actually provide specific information and take action.  For instance, I encountered a technical glitch on their end in the actual purchase process.  I checked in several times through chat and phone calls.  Each time the agent expressed empathy and understanding, but basically told me to just wait for the problem to be resolved.  Several days passed, and it didn't get resolved.  I found it impossible to speak to a supervisor who perhaps could do more.  I spent a couple of hours on hold.  Then I found an agent who said, ""I think I can fix this.""  He did.

That being said my family chose Carvana for simplicity. That ended up being far from reality. For starters we secured a vehicle when it first posted on the website for sale. That deposit sat for almost 5 weeks before we pulled out. Essentially we could never finish the purchase because it was going through prep...there was certainly something else there but never disclosed. The terrible customer service you get from Ai messaging and reps that cannot speak outside of canned responses is concerning. Lucky for us when we decided to pull the deposit another vehicle was spotted on Carvana and we secured it. This time it was ready to sell and the process started immediately. When it came time to schedule a delivery 2 weeks in advance that went smooth. The night before the arrival of our new car we get a confirmation... Be ready between our agreed time. My wife and I scheduled off work for this delivery. We were set. The next day we get a text not a real person call... Your transport was delayed and it will be another 2 weeks! Are you serious!? This is how disconnected Carvana is from reality. At this point our trust in the schedule wasn't there but the delivery did finally happen. I can only wish this was the end of the circus but it wasn't. Now comes the registration requirements that comes via messaging again. There were a wide range of issues but the biggest one was being told I had to get a emissions test before the registration could finalize. My county does not require emissions for a gas powered vehicle. It took weeks for them to figure that out. Next it was additional paperwork they already had but needed me to send a copy because apparently they lost it. This whole process started in April 2021 and just ended September 2021.

Carvana claims it it some other companys fault that the title is lost and hasnt been reissued. They other company is short staffed and slow to respond b/c COVIDbut Carvana is dealer we purchased from and they should take responsibility and fix the problem. 1-Dealers are supposed to provide title and registration within 45 days of the sale, 2-we have never heard back within 72 hours, and 3-we dont have the title or registration so there has been no resolution. We are very frustrated and do not feel like we can drive our car because, when we were pulled over the officer was all freaked out because the car wasnt registered anywhere and that looked suspicious.

I have been dealing with them to get 2,000$ of repairs done on my car for over a month. FINALLY 35 days in they approved it. I had to keep calling everyday. I was given a run around saying it will get solved and someone will call me back. Sadly they never called and I had to call everyday for updates. I kept getting transferred to other people without being told. I now have an expired temp license plate and cant drive nor get around, to work nor school without having to pay for ubers. I called on Tuesday September 14 to get an extension. They said it takes 24 hours. I have called everyday and same thing, it will take 24 hours. Its Saturday September 18 (4 days passed at this point). I called and got told they cant do it until Monday and that they will cover my Uber expenses. Yet could you imagine how long it would take to get reimbursed for that?! I dont even want to go through that trouble. I called today and had a rude customer service agent tell me we cant do anything about it. I asked if it could get escalated and he said no, it wont go anywhere nor will you get a reply anyways so its not worth it. I have ALL screenshots and emails and RECORDED phone calls. This is so upsetting. I am still dealing with this car issue for 37 days exact. This is horrible. A Fortune 500 company they really do not care about their customers. I am beyond upset. They tried sending me 200$ for the inconveniences, but having to pay for ubers to get around or friends gas to borrow their cars is not okay. At this point with the money Ive personally spent I rightfully deserve over 500$ worth of compensation.

When I did receive the car I was excited until the inspection I had done the same day turned up Bad. It has been in an accident and the repairs done were shotty so it made it easy for the inspection. So I call the following morning to ask whats going on, the representative Kassidy told me that the repairs most not have been reported in which I responded what about your 150 point inspection you should of been aware. I was told that I could call the number given to me on the 7 day guarantee. I called informed them that I was not happy with the car and wanted to do a swap. I found  a new car and called back to do the swap. We set up a day and delivery time. Then I get a phone call, voice mail and email within 2 hours. I call back. Now I give them more information not need before and I give excesses to my bank account again not needed before. I  was informed that the car swap would cost an additional $1100.00. I said no way did I want that deal. To cancel the order.I was told that I could find another car with terms under $452. a month. Call them back and do the swap then. So they canceled the entire order in a way that was apparently not the right way because now I am informed that they have to personally hand write word for word a rebuild on the order so that they can process my return and refund. At this point I am scared of what's next. They are not good at this at all. They should be more than ashamed and I am leaving out more of the experience because it is to much.

2224,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,3,09/15/2021,"I purchased my vehicle the second week in July; the sales process was everything that a dealership sale is NOT. I was able to sit at home, review the photos and data provided by Carvana to evaluate the vehicle, and determine that yes, this was the vehicle I wanted.It was pretty much all they said up to this point-- the sale, signing, details were all very easy to complete, and took me less than 40 minutes, if that.Then came reality: My vehicle was scheduled for delivery on August 5th, about 2 weeks from the sale date. Carvana even called me to switch me from ""delivery to my house"" to ""delivery to a designated pickup spot"", which saved me $9 on the delivery, but more importantly, made it so that if I wanted to return the car, the delivery fee would also be REFUNDABLE.  At this point, i thought things were going swimmingly.On August 1st, I got a late night text saying my delivery was delayed-- and was moved out another 2 weeks. 3 days prior to that date, another text and another delay. Long story short, it wasn't until SEPTEMBER 8 that my vehicle was delivered. In the meantime, I had called Carvana to complain about this and request compensation, several times-- which they reluctantly did....On to the vehicle: MANY (at least 6) paint ""imperfections"" that were not detailed in their report, including one that actually was lightly rusted, clearly visible on the car. They reported ""level 1"", meaning ""a fingernail won't catch on the scratch"" but in fact, most of what they didn't detail was clearly greater than level 1.Carvana's detailing was hit and miss-- I found clearly unvacuumed, uncleaned areas underneath seats and tucked away in little-accessed corners, as well as the original sales paperwork with the prior owner's information still in the glove compartment, along with Carvana's original inspection documents, which honestly looked like they'd been filled out by young twenty-somethings who were reluctantly doing the job.Two of my tires were at 5/32"", verging on needing replacement, but right at Carvana's border-line. The other two were at 7/32""-- not a ton of tread.  The cabin air filter had not been changed out, and the rear shocks were worn enough that my mechanic recommended they be replaced. The car drove as though it had been sitting for several months, which in fact it had been-- since the end of June when Carvana processed it and conditioned it.Overall, I am satisfied with my vehicle for the price; I was actually prepared for the delivery delays I experienced because I'd read other folks' ""nightmare stories"" about Carvana. I figured that if I got 2 out of the 3 (good price, good vehicle, fast service) that'd be about the best I could hope for-- and that's what I got.  However, I feel that Carvana did NOT pay enough attention to the little details (documentation of vehicle condition, complete detailing of vehicle). It feels like they have a FORMULA to follow-- get the vehicle, determine quickly if they'll want to sell it, and if so, do a quick and dirty cleanup to get that process moving, especially in these times of ""car shortages"".  The shock absorber issue in my vehicle is a great example of this-- while they are not exactly ""done"", replacement will get the car to an even better place. Why leave two tires on at 5/32"" when you could replace them and give the customer a better value? Because it's not a better value for Carvana.Ultimately, Carvana is STILL a car DEALER. They may not do some of the things we who have shopped at dealerships dislike, like high pressure sales, etc, but some other things still stick-- like getting away with whatever the customer cannot or does not find. Overall, you MAY have a positive experience, like I did (all in all) but KEEP AN EYE ON EVERYTHING.",no response,No response

2237,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,09/14/2021,Zero stars. Nine months waiting for vehicle tags and registration. Military family wanting to register the vehicle in home of record. Nine months of run around. Promised a checked would be overnighted to cover a rental car since they are no longer able to issue temp tags (weve had temp tags issued over and over for the past nine months). No check ever came. Now the vehicle sits bc it is not legal to drive without tags. In our many calls we have had to explain the situation over and over to each customer service representative because nothing is noted on our account. One phone call was answered by a young child! Someone working from home Im assuming and their child answered the phone. Do not ever use this company unless you take care of all your own registration. The claim that they will do it is not true. They have an outside vendor take care of it (or in our case NOT take care of it) and just blame them when its not done.,no response,No response

It most definitely wasn't in my experience. First, I was moving from ****** to ****, so there were some challenges in confirming my identity given the two addresses. I understand this, BUT was told different things by every single person I talked to at Carvana. They kept me jumping through hoops to provide what they needed. It was always a different story with every person I talked to. VERY frustrating! Secondly, they canceled my order without notifying me at all. I just happened to be on the app looking at something when I noticed it. I had to go through the whole process a second time to secure the car I had ordered. I should have walked away at this point...Thirdly, I had a scheduled delivery date. I had planned to use my new car on a road trip the weekend after delivery. The day before my delivery, I received a confirmation text at 8 am that my car would be delivered the next day. At 12 pm, I received a second text telling me my car wouldn't arrive for another 5 days. 5 days??? How does that change happen in 3 hours?? This was a HUGE inconvenience as I now had to rent a car for the weekend. I reached out to Carvana multiple times asking them to at the very least cover the rental car. They refused. They offered a small amount per day, but not enough to cover the rental. The silver lining is I do love my new vehicle, but the entire process to get there was extremely frustrating and not at all customer-focused. Had they tried to make all of THEIR mistakes right, I would have been more understanding, but at this point I would NOT recommend Carvana to anyone.",no response,No response

2247,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,09/13/2021,"I would give this company 0 stars if I could. I had the most nightmarish experience with Carvana, from the beginning of the transaction right up until the end. I'll start with the fact that I only used their ""services"" because I needed a car quickly, as I had just moved to a new city and was due to start a new job in a couple of days. I purchased the car on a Thursday, on the pretense that it was to arrive that following Sunday. You know what they say...if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. On the Sunday it was supposed to arrive, I received an automated text that it would be delayed until Wednesday. No explanation as to why. This happened once more, getting delayed until the following Friday. After the second delay I called the company and was put on hold for 40 minutes, only for them to tell me that I had to communicate with my bank (from which I already was approved and received a loan) to tell them to send the loan information to Carvana. I was very confused as to why I was playing the middleman in this scenario, and nothing was communicated to me in the beginning of this process by Carvana. Regardless, I did so, and was finally put on the ""Carvana **** of America Approved List"". So. I was then scheduled to get my car the following Monday (1 week and 1 day after I was originally supposed to get it). I received another robo-text saying it was delayed due to ""maintenance."" No explanation of what work needed to be done. I had to call and be put on hold again in order to be told that the hood latch suddenly needed fixing. At this point I was simply confused why I was being communicated with via robot, and had no direct point of contact from the company. The fact that my car was delayed 3 times at this point should have prompted the company to take special interest in my case, however that was certainly not my experience. So I was told I would get the car on Wednesday after the hood latch was fixed. Come Wednesday... YOU GUESSED IT. Another automated text message that my car is not coming. So I called and I said I need someone assigned to my case to call me every day. They said OK and that they would follow up on Thursday, and gave me a specific time that they would call. Nobody called me whatsoever, and I had to call AGAIN to ask what was happening with my car. They told me I would not get it until the following Wednesday (OVER 2 weeks after I was originally supposed to get it). I said no and that this is unacceptable. I asked what the delay was with the hood latch repair, and they said that they were ""waiting on a part, but it shouldn't take long because they could order it from Amazon Prime"" ?? So I said ""well you ordered it a few days ago didn't you? So you should have it by now? can you check on the status of the repair?"" So the guy put me on hold and after 10 minutes said ""good news! We had the part and your car is actually repaired and ready to go!"". When I tell you I was in shock. I quite literally had to walk the customer service representative through how to check on the status of my car. Who knows how long I would've been waiting, car-less, with $15,000 in limbo had I not instructed this poorly trained employee on how to do his job. So finally I end up getting the car exactly 2 weeks after I originally was promised it. Now, the car was fine until the 7 day money back guarantee ended (fun coincidence). On day 10, the brakes started screeching, the horn stopped working, and the car would not start. I had to get it jumped in the parking garage in my office one day. The next day, it would not start again, and it would not catch a jump, so I had to get it towed!! It was at that point I decided I would no longer be dealing with Carvana and had to give the car back. I called and made a huge stink about it because the first two customer service people told me that my only options were to trade in or ""voluntarily repossess the car""?? So I was like no way you guys are taking this car back or I'm suing. So that got them moving and they finally agreed (after two people hung up on me and I waited on hold for at least 2 hours) to take the car back at a full refund. I haven't received my refund yet but the car is officially off my hands. In short, this is the most disorganized, ridiculously idiotic, and fraudulent company maybe that I've ever dealt with in my entire life.

Finally I was sent to their ""executive"" agent who informed me that they could do nothing for my situation and to basically just deal with it. Their customer support is a joke. When a promise is made to a customer you should honor it. Even if it was ""a mistake."" it's a shame because carvana itself was easy to deal with and did make the buying process simple. The car was just how it was advertised. All that considered I would not buy from them again because everything to do with their partner was such a terrible experience.",no response,No response

2281,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,09/09/2021,"Horrible selling experience. I saw commercials about how easy it was to use Carvana, so I decided to check it out. I go thru the entire process and give up personal info only to find out they dont do business in ******. Which I sort of expected but there were so many points in the process where they asked for my   and address and at no point did the say anything. So, let me walk you thru the process of selling with Carvana. On their site they ask for license plate and state or VIN#. Since they dont do business in ******, they should place a disclaimer here. Nip it in the bud and tell people up front if you can or cannot do business!The next steps require you to enter information about the car, mileage, color etc. It also asks for your zip code, which I did and Carvana gave me an offer. If you like the offer, then you proceed to send them a copy of your drivers license and car title so they can verify ownership. Both have my address on it, but I guess they still didnt catch that they dont do business in ******. I sent my info to Carvana and their site says it should take up to 48 hours to verify. In my case I waited a week for them to verify, I didnt want to rush them, and I was in no huge rush to sell. During this time, I did receive a missed call from their rep checking in on the selling process. If she has my number, Im assuming shes looking at my profile and did not say anything about my location. After waiting the week, I decided to reach out to Carvana and see if I was missing anything that would prevent us from continuing. To confirm my request, they asked for me to enter my email and zip code, again. Someone reached out to me the next day via text but did not say anything about my location. Later that day I received a message that my offer was approved, and I would proceed to the next steps. Since they approved my offer, and it took them a week to do their due diligence I assumed everything was a go. There did not seem like there was an issue anywhere. The next step required me to choose my payment, I opted for direct deposit, so I gave them my bank information and I even had to verify my social number, which Im assuming they got from when they contacted ******* DMV. After providing that information I had to schedule an appointment for someone to pick up. This is when things went south. There were no appointments available in my area, so I had to call for assistance. I called and their rep and could not care less about being there. I advised him I was instructed to call for an appointment and his response was You are supposed to do it on your online account but let me look and see. Honestly if I could, I would! He asked me to verify email and zip code, I provided him that and he did not even address my issue. He advised me I had to call a number to schedule an appointment, he provided me the SAME number I had dialed. He was an idiot, so I thanked him, hung up and called back hoping for another agent. The next agent, ******* was the only saving ***** for Carvana. I explained to her I needed to schedule an appointment to sell my car, she took my email and zip code. She placed me on hold and when she returned, she THANKED me for waiting, she said she checked with her supervisor and confirmed that Carvana does not do business in ******. Seriously? All that wasted effort and for what? I dont blame *******, she was sweet, courteous and is smart enough to just tell me the truth instead of making me jump thru hoops for no reason.",no response,No response

The trade was a worry of mine. I don't know why I was so worried. Carvana took all the worry out of the process. I got a very good offer for my trade and the information shared during the process kept us in the loop. We received updates on delivery and pick up. We arrived at the Carvana building. It was impressive to see the cars stacked in the clear glass structure. We were met by an equally happy representative. I was waiting for a sales pitch on added features or a surprise dealer add on list. There were absolutely no hidden fees. Everything was completely transparent.

It had been serviced at the same dealership every couple of thousand miles between 2 owners since it was sold new. Never been in an accident. I decided to have it delivered out of network as I was about 40 miles outside of their *********** hub and I have CPTSD from my time in the Army, so its hard for me to get outside let alone have a friend drive me 40 miles. I waited until August 10th to call in and ask for an update on my new vehicles status. Apparently it had been sitting in the ** hub for at least 10 days waiting for a final inspection. The rep said thats extremely unusual and I told them I wanted my Jeep delivered in network because it was taking waaaaay too long to complete a final inspection. So they set a delivery date of August 18th.On August 16th Im told that the Jeeps hauler broke down and that the Jeep would be delayed until the 24th. Ok, cant help that one. Finally on the 23rd I get a call telling me that the *** light came on and theyll need to take it to THEIR Jeep dealership and it will be delayed 3 weeks. I explained to them that I could easily take it into the local Jeep dealership and have it fixed within days, please just deliver the ******* Jeep.Upon delivery everything looks as it should and we **** the cosmetic issues that were visible ( They missed at least 5 distinct cosmetic issues and the back trunk panel was completely loose with scratches all over it). As soon as I pulled out of the parking lot the traction control button failed and the 4WD! Symbol came on. I drove it to the dealership within an hour of having it and 3 days later they call me up to tell me the *** (Power Control module) needed to be replaced, that the whole undercarriage was covered in mud and grass and that the engine had been flooded at one point. They told me Id be visiting the shop monthly for the rest of the Jeeps life if I kept it.Obviously Ive decided to return it. This is Carvanas money pit to invest in, not mine. This is my first time buying a vehicle on my own as an adult at 32 and I have to say I feel sick over it. I pushed myself hard over the last month trying to handle the stress of this and I am just done.

I am an insurance agent in the state of Georgia. The state of Georgia requires a binder of insurance that provides liability coverage to register a vehicle. I provided Carvana with that binder which I wrote in my office and then they told me that they require a 60 day binder of insurance to release the car to me. I informed them of Georgia state law regarding vehicle registration they told me I was incorrect. haha it was kind of funny but extremely frustrating. After telling them that not only do they not need a 60 day binder, but that also my insurance company (largest auto insurer in the world) only has 30 day binders. I was essentially told tough luck. So I asked if instead they could release my vehicle unregistered and I would deal with the tag office myself. Of course, once again, Carvana insisted that according to Georgia law, I am not allowed to register my own vehicle. I directed them to the ********** of ******* website where it showed the process where regular people could register their vehicle. This of course cancelled my delivery date and I was told I had til tomorrow (Sunday) to get the mysterious and nonexistent 60 day binder. This company has a fleet of work-from-home bureaucrats who have no idea what they are talking about.

Well THAT didn't Happen INSTEAD I was never called and was GIVEN a DATE and Time. I was ****** about that. So I called and spoke with a ******** Really did go above and beyond by apologizing for the delay and reaching out to the different departments to find out why I had a delay and to see what would be a better date to have it delivered that worked for me.

After going to multiple local dealerships, I couldnt find any car I wanted due to low inventory & insanely high markups. I never thought I would get a used car, but when I saw a commercial, I figured I might as well check it out .. the website had the car I was looking for.. a 2021 ******* Tucson, with less than 10k miles on it. Trade-in: so quick and easy.. typed in my license plate, answered a few questions and instantly was asked if I wanted to trade-in or sell. Carvana offered me the actual KBB value, rather than making a high profit and lowballing me. I actually was shocked by the price so I sent them photos and asked for confirmation. They confirmed and I moved forward.Purchase: applied and was instantly approved with a less than $200 down payment (******* wanted $3,500 down for the same monthly payment). I clicked to order the car I wanted. Uploaded my paperwork (license, current lien ****** payoff, etc) and then waited for them to review my documents. The next morning a rep called me asked for for my change of address (my license didnt match my current information). She informed me that she would send me an email and to upload the new document via the link in the email, but instead I thought I could just upload it on the app under my order. This is where I made a mistake because it didnt alert the rep that I submitted my requested ************** only have 24-hours or the car you are holding is sent back for others to order. I was notified the following morning that because my documents werent received, I lost the order. I was so upset and called and within 10-minutes, 2 different employees figured it all out for me and had all my final approvals completed and it all worked out.My delivery was set for a week later (car was coming from down south to up north) but 2-days prior I got an email that it was rescheduled. I called to inquire and they informed me it was due to Hurricane *** and the storm flooding.. relevant and so it was rescheduled for 3 days later. I called every day over the next few days to see the current location, and they were able to tell me exactly where it was and even the exact time it was expected to reach my city. It was on time for the pickup.I chose to do pickup because I wanted to see the vending machine. It was the quickest process ever. I was there less than an hour, they had all my documents already ready in the ********* was able to take it for a drive and ask any questions. Trade-in was also so easy and quick. Everything was flawless. The car is even better than it looked in photos & was spotless cleaned inside/out. This review probably sounds fake by how good it sounds, but I am leaving it because I read so many bad reviews that made me hesitant to try it and Im so happy I did. Every time I called Carvana, I was never on hold longer than 10-minutes. You also have the option to save your place and have the rep call you back when its your place in line.

Carvana offered compensation and their customer service was very good. I am very happy with the second Explorer but it was not as clean as the first one.

The bumper was obviously painted black not professionally . It's not a minor deal- it makes the truck look really junky. I told carvana about it and their response is ""sorry that's not covered under the warranty and it should've been brought to out attention within the 7 days after purchase"". The bottom line is carvana sold me a vehicle and within months the paint is peeling off in chunks, and they refuse to correct their mistake.",no response,No response

After deciding to trade my car in with them, I had to call Carvana to ensure that something was entered correctly on my order.  I spoke with an agent who helped get everything solved.  Next thing I know, this agent is texting me from his personal device to ask me if I wanted to be friends with him on social media and he proceeded to flirt with me.  I was shocked.  My personal information was supposed to be secure, but it was taken by this employee and used inappropriately.  I went to management with screenshots and my concerns, asking them for help to ensure me that my personal data was secure and not at risk.  Management was very rude and did not offer much in the form of assurance.  The ordeal was dragged out for several days.  Not once did Carvana offer to make the situation right by offering even the slightest reduction in the price of the car, or something to make up for the trouble.  At this point, going to a dealership would have been easier.  To add insult to injury, when I picked up the new car, it had body damage that was not noted on the listing and they also put temporary plates on that were set to expire in 2 days.  Not sure if I am keeping the car or not.  Dont feel great about doing business with a company who has this kind of customer service attitude.  They did offer to fix the body damage, so that is something.  I will let you draw your own conclusions.  Sounds like some people have flawless experiences with this company and others have terrible ones.  Does not seem to be a whole lot of in between",no response,No response

Was called the night before I was to pick up the vehicle and was explained that check was not approved even though management approved it and how would I like to proceed. This has been the third time I have had to change my work schedule and get someone to drive me three hours to pick up vehicle. There is a huge lack of communication within the organization. Customer is told one thing while ******************** is doing the opposite. This has not been an easy process like they claim. I would not refer anyone to do business with them.

The check engine light came on, so I made an appointment to get it looked at.  While waiting to go to my appointment with a Chrysler dealership there was a big rain and the car had a puddle in the front and back of the car.  They fixed the sunroof thinking that was where the leak was coming from. The check engine light was on because the Catalylic Converter needed to be replaced.  Then the air only worked on the passenger side of the car and it started squeaking really bad. The squeaking ended up being the sub-frame, motor mount and stabilizer.  They fixed the A/C compressor but the car is still leaking.  Took it to the body shop and they still cant find the leak.  The car is back in the shop because there is knocking in the steering wheel, the dashboard has a short and the front end still isn't right.  The warranty company has a list of authorized dealers but none of them are an actual dealership.  If I wasnt doing DoorDash I would have never figured out all of that stuff before the Warranty ran out.  The car was in an accident and I know because the driver side door has cotton fabric whereas the other 3 doors have leather.  The car came with the tape still on the bumper where it was repaired.

They told us that we should have it on or before August 6.  That is a really long time to bring us the car, but we accepted based on the price, the make and model, model year, and low mileage.  On August 5, we got a communication from them stating that they had a record of our car leaving their lot, but that they could no longer find the car.  It was missing (? - seriously?).  They offered us a different similar style car, one model year newer and higher, but still low mileage for the same price.  We agreed and were told we would have the car by the 12th.  On the 10th we got a message that they car had not passed the emissions control test and could not be sold out of state until that was resolved and we would have it by the 14th.  On the 14th, we contacted them and were told that our car was now in another state for testing the emission control and we would have it by the 17th.  On the 16th they called and told us that due to storms in the area they were unable to load our car on the carrier to bring it to Indiana and that we would have it by the 23rd at 2:30 in the afternoon.  At 2:45 my husband called Carvana and they told him that the back windshield was shattered and they couldn't bring it to us until they repaired it.This means that we have now been waiting for six weeks for a car that keeps getting delayed.  This is not just poor customer service but has put us in a real bind without having a second car.  Some families can make that work -we can not.

Should had bought at a local dealership.Got a car delivered on July 15th, The very next day, on 16th, I call them and let them know that all the four tires are worn out and will need to be replaced. (Yay for the 150 point inspection that Carvana brags about, of course it's a lie. You will find tons of horror stories on reddit) The front left tire had bits and pieces of rubber coming off. The representative on the phone told me that Carvana will take care of it. The car was had no mechanical issues and since the representative assured me Carvana will taek care of the tires, I decided to keep it. He told me to go through SilverRock (which is their warranty partner) and if SilverRock denies it, Carvana will ask SilverRock to approve it.Work kept me busy and fast forward 15 days, I went to a local tire shop and they followed all the procedures listed by SilverRock. After 2 days (yes after 2 days) I get a message from SilverRock stating the claim has been denied because it's not covered under warranty since it's a wearable part. Of course it's not covered under warranty because it's a wearable part, but I was under the assumption that Carvana must have already informed SilverRock and taken care of it.Now begins the worst customer service I ever had to deal with. From the day the claim was denied until today I have made about 13 calls (in 2 weeks) to Carvana to get them to approve the claim (4 tires).  Below are some of the excuses the customer service is always prepared to tell me every time I call:: We are still working on it : We are waiting for the manager's approval : Let me escalate the issue and call you back in a couple of hours ( no body ever calls back, probably just want to get rid of the call since they don't know what to do): I have taken down notes and someone will call you back soon. (no body ever called): We should have the approval in 48 hours ( That was more than a week ago)Keep in mind, I called back the very next day when the car was delivered (they have 7 days return policy) and if the representative had told me that we would not be able to change the tires, I would had sent the car back immediately. Who would want to spend $600 on a '150 POINT INSPECTED SECOND HAND LIKE-NEW CAR'. 13 calls (and 13 different customer service representatives) in a period of 2 weeks and they are still giving me the run around. It looks like nobody at Carvana knows what's going on and what exactly to do or maybe they just don't care now because I am past the 7 return policy.

I called Carvana to cancel the trade - i just want my car back, this isn't working. They said we'll deliver tomorrow. Next morning the truck pulls up to my house... EMPTY.

If it shows ""Sale Pending"" still request the vehicle they will offer it up if the Hold or Sale falls through.Delivery experience also, ok, not great, not terrible One bad thing is you really only get a quick drive while the driver is there.Dash had cleaning materials left to dry leaving a large white stain, Delivery person got most out. I had to clean 3 times. Also had to clean entire car, looked good until you wiped you hand on something. Made 3 big white towels very *****, not sure what ""Sanitized"" means Check out vehicle carefully, as you can see the Transporter that brought the vehicle to *********** to Carvana, dropped another car on a portion of the roof, estimated at $1500 @ Macco (Silverrock and Carvanas Prefered provider for the warranty issues)The car was delivered with 3mm of brakes and Warped Rotors, P0324 Engine code, and no licence plate lights, plus the unnoticed damage the transporter made to the roof. Great experience right?Wait, there's more So vehicle arrived on 8-4, scheduled to get checked out by Monroe (Silverrock Warrenty provider) on Saturday 8-7 Due to severe backups at most shops, Brakes, Rotors replaced, received vehicle back on Monday 8-9,  Monroe does not do Engine Codes, so, off to *** Boys (Another Silverrock direct provider) received vehicle back on Tuesday ****, P0324 code found, and part not replaced, and they wanted to charge me for the diagnostic. I was told to drive the car and bring it back. I did not pay the diagnostic. P0324 code is for a knock sensor, it causes rough idle and an extreme decrease in gas mileage. We will see how that goes, they ""reset"" the computer. THE mileage prior to the reset was ***** mpg.I owned the exact same year and model until it was rear-ended with ******* miles, YES 294K on it!MPG IS ***** ALL DAY LONG.Now please keep in mind I have not even driven the vehicle 50 miles, I'm suppose to have 7 days, they extended it to ****. Should have been extended to 14 days, which would be ****, period.Was told someone from Carvana will ""Reach out"" before the ""trial period"" expires. NEVER HAPPENED.So now I paid a down-payment of $5500, for a car that technically was illegal to drive, damaged, and yes sort of fixed, but still has issues, and I have no trial period return policy to fall back on.Not sure how this will all pan out, but I will update every fact here.But I think we'll start with the $1500 worth of damage done prior to delivery to Carvana, that was not done by the delivery driver, he was great and noted it.Silverrock, is a nightmare to deal with, as a customer and a repair center, even though I was using thier ""preferred"" vendors. The vendors were cringing when I said what I was there for and for who.I have not received one phone call from Carvana, Silverock, regarding any of these issues.Oh and I had to RENT a car because the *** I bought was in the shop from the day after it arrived. So let's add that to the ""Great Experiance"" $400/wk Every single bit of this is true. I have had to reach out and help vendors get the vehicle to the state it is today.Damage has not been addressed to this day, it was estimated by MACCO, 8-7-2021 I'm sure it will all pan out.Update 8-14-2021, A lot of dust getting in car, why? Cabin Air Filter is SHOT. Might as well check the Engine Air Filter, SHOT. Here goes another $60, of parts that were never even checked, even by the guys that did the 2 Diagnostics and check, both reports OK. SEE PICTURES Update ****, Drove car about 2 hours, came home car sat for 3 hours, upon return and start up. Car went into complete melt down. Said it was ""overheating"" Engine was cold.

Afterwards they tried to delay my delivery again because they couldn't get in contact with whomever they sent the car to for repairs, once I finally got my car it was defective and wouldn't charge and didn't even have the portable charger unit that was supposed to come standard with the vehicle.After calling customer service multiple times they finally allowed me to simply switch out the car for another one of equal or less value, after they finally brought me the new car, a Chevrolet Cruze, I spent a few days with it only to find out one night that my passenger side rear light and turn signal didn't work. Carvana tried to switch that car out as well but I didn't trust them to deliver a proper vehicle, so I opted to go to one of their approved mechanics. Instead of helping me the costumer service just gave the same number from the agreement paperwork I got to contact SilverRock, a third party company Carvana uses.At the time of this writing I still have to deal with Carvana, and now, their partners to fix an issue that should have been rectified long before it reached my driveway. I was hoping to make purchasing a car as stress free as possible, but now I feel like going to a real dealership would have actually been more enjoyable and easy.",no response,No response

First I didnt get delivery on time had to pay one month insurance in advance just for the car to be delivered one month later then a month and half later ******** reports rust problems Carvana gave me the run around like rust happens the same month you buy a car I would be posting the pictures online for every one to see,no response,No response

2491,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,5,08/15/2021,"Best experience ever. Here is the trick: PLAN. I honestly planned and researched what make and model I knew Inwas going to buy for over a year. I knew I needed a car in about a year, so I started to plan. I got to know the app and website in and out. I called and asked questions. I called the Loan officers. I knew exactly what I was getting into BEFORE I WAS FORCED to buy a car. The process takes several days, and if you are desperate for transportation immediately, this could be problematic and might not be how you want to go about purchasing a vehicle. Most of the 1 and 2 star reviews reflect this which is really too bad. I think this is the challenge of Carvana. Fortunately for me, I had a backup vehicle to use while waiting for all my paperwork to go through. My car actually did die, so I didn't so a trade in. I can't comment on that process. That said, I also planned to pay the extra for the vehicle drop off delivery. It was HEAVENLY. Just pay the extra and relish in the fact you don't have to have any hassle. Literally, none. It was amazing. If you do a good bit of planning, know what you are getting into, browse the website and the inventory of cars with with EXACT features you need/want/don't want with your budget, this this is the experience you need and deserve! Please don't use this if you really don't know what you want out of a car. Do your research, watch the trends, budget carefully, know what you are getting into. I can't stress enough. Plan. Know what you want and can afford before the car breaks down. If it's an emergency accident, and your car is totaled I would go to a dealer where you can buy one the exact day you need it. If you have the option to plan and watch the trends, know your budget, select the features you want, save certain cars, then this is the BEST way to buy a car.

We soon received an invitation to see what Carvana would pay for our trade, whether we bought from them or not. We answered a short questionnaire about the car and had an offer in a couple minutes. It was $1500 more than another national dealer and thousands more than the dealer we bought the car from new. Then we found a car we really wanted. In their extensive set of photos Carvana took great care to point out every flaw in the appearance, some so minor that we couldn't really see them in the photos. They pointed out some sun fading on the dash that we can't see to this day. We checked out their financing and didn't like the rate so we passed. We completed the sale and got a delivery date 6 days hence. It was delayed twice. We were disappointed but only because we were excited to get the car. Instead of 6 days it took 14, not a big deal. The car arrived and we took it for a test drive. It was immaculate, better than expected. We signed and handed over the keys to our trade. A little hitch came up regarding the title. For some reason Carvana intended to title it in only one of our names instead of both. It took 3 phone calls but in the end it was titled the way we wanted.

The process at before the purchase and while at the dealership seemed so easy and seamless! I was impressed and quickly disappointed and have been let down over and over ever since!   For starters they sold me a vehicle with the wrong key fob. I was told by the dealer it was a safety feature that the car would only start with the fob in the cup holder. My bad for thinking this was a thing! Didnt think anything of it until I stopped an hour away from the dealer and couldnt lock/unlock the doors. Called the dealer and was told the battery was dead and they would send a locksmith. In the meantime bought a new battery and still didnt work. Waited 3 hours to get back on the road. Once we got home we took it to a local dealer and was told the fob was for a completely different vehicle - so we called Carvana and was told we would have to send the key back or purchase  our own fobs. Which we did because we had to drive! Carvana promised a reimbursement would be sent overnight- a week and a half later i was still calling daily for the reimbursement!  Then comes registration.  We live in a self register state, so our paperwork shows we paid taxes/registration fees and the dealer told us they would send us a check to get plates for the car. A month and a half later and an expired temp tag we finally got the registration paperworkbut no check! Instead a letter stating we would need to pay the state and they will reimburse us. We already paid the fees in the loan and have the paperwork to prove it but i have to pay again???? Been on the phone more times in the last month for reimbursement for key fobs, new temp tags so I could legally drive, and now again for clarification on who pays the registration.  One person says i will have to pay and another says there should be a check included. All the while on hold and being hung up on multiple times. Still waiting on a resolution and currently being told to wait to register the car until they figure it out. Back to temp tags- **************** told us multiple times new temps tags were going to be available on the portal, which never happened. Then was told they would email them because agent didnt load them into the portal correctly. Yet again, never happened and had to call back several times. Finally, after asking for a supervisor multiple times a temp tag was sent 2 days after the original expired. Speaking to a supervisor is a whole other issue.

Some of them have been resolved but I am still wasting a lot of time waiting on the phone to try and speed up the long wait time for my registration. This will be a long review explaining the issues that I have been dealing with. I will preface this with the positive aspect of my transaction for Carvana. I got a good deal on the truck I purchased and they gave me a good trade in price on my old car. Once my truck is officially registered to me I think I will be happy with the truck I purchased, but I am very unlikely to do business with Carvana ever again. I traded in my car and ordered a ****** Tacoma on 02 Jun 2021. The initial transaction was convenient and easy as advertised. Carvana offered a fair price for the car I traded in and a good deal on the truck I purchased. I waited two weeks for delivery, which is fine. The day before the scheduled delivery I got a call from the local Carvana shop saying that they needed to remove some aftermarket electrical modifications and would need to delay delivery. That only delayed delivery by a day so no big issues there. Once the truck arrived it was in the condition that was advertised and drove well. I was and still am happy with the truck. Overall the initial purchase and delivery process went smoothly. I started having Issues the day after my seven day trial ended. I got a brake system override light on my way home from work one night. The truck was still running fine so I wasn't ****** concerned about the light. When I got home I discovered that my brake lights were not working. I scheduled an appointment with the only shop in my area that Carvana's warranty service would cover the $50 deductible. When I pulled into the shop parking lot they called and said they do not have any appointments available for that day and I would have to reschedule. There weren't any dates available that were soon enough that I could wait and continue driving around with no brake lights. That's not Carvanas fault but it would be nice if there was more than one shop within an hour of me that I could get my truck repaired without paying a $50 deductible. After searching forums I was pretty sure that I knew what the problem was and I was able to fix it my self easily and cheaply. The truck came with a cap on the bed. somewhere along the line someone had cut the wiring to the third brake light on the cap and left the wires still wired to the brake lights on the truck. The loose wires were causing a short so I removed them and rewired the third brake light. I don't know if this happened prior to or during the previously mentioned removal of aftermarket electrical modifications. In either case it calls into question the thoroughness of Carvana's inspections process.The next issue I dealt with was that my original car loan was still not paid off after a longer than expected time. I believe Carvana states that if you trade in a car to them they will have the original car loan paid off in **** days following the end of your 7 day trial period. This time came and passed so I started looking into it. I called Carvana and they said they had mailed the check to the bank. After checking with the bank they had not received the check. After checking with Carvana again I discovered that they had sent the check to the wrong bank. The two banks had very similar names so this was likely due to a simple miscommunication. After I pointed out the mistake that had occurred, Carvana quickly mailed a new check to the correct bank and the loan was paid off shortly after. I made an additional payment on the car I traded in during this time. The bank issued me a refund for the additional payment. If money were tighter that could have caused problems for me, but in the end everything worked out okay. The last issue that I am still waiting to be resolved is the long wait time for my registration to arrive. The registration process began after my 7 day trail period ended. It took about a month for Carvana to submit my registration paperwork to their third party vendor that handles registration. The registration has remained in this stage of the process for about a month and getting accurate status updates has proved to be nearly impossible. During this time my original temporary operating permit expired and I was issued a new one. The new temporary operating permit expires three months from now. That is a concerning timeframe because the worst case scenario given this timeframe is a four and a half month wait for my registration to be completed, which I would consider unacceptable. I started contacting Carvana to try and get status updates. One advocate told me they would contact the third party vendor handling the registration and call me back with an update. That advocate never called me back. I called again and another advocate told me that the paperwork was submitted to the *** just prior to my call. I was excited because it sounded like progress was being made. I was told to expect an email reflecting the status update and a tracking number. That was last week and I never received said email. I contacted Carvana through their text service to try and verify that information and they said there had been a miscommunication and my registration had not been submitted to the ***. I don't consider this to be a miscommunication. As far as I can tell the advocate lied to me and completely fabricated that status update. I checked with the *** and they have not received my registration. I called Carvana again today to try to verify where my registration is in the process and the advocate told me it is still with the third party vendor handling the registration. I asked if there is a number for the third party vendor so I could speak with them and the advocate told me that doesn't exist. I asked to speak with a manager and was promised a 24 hour callback from a supervisor. I am currently waiting for that call. I'm hoping that this can be resolved soon as I purchased the truck for an extended road trip that will start at the beginning of September and would like permanent plates for that. Things could be worse. At least the new temporary operating permit is still valid so I can still drive the truck for the time being. I understand that Covid has probably made registering vehicles difficult. But, the fact that Carvana has not been forthright with information or honest about my registration status is concerning.",no response,No response

I called and received all the information I need for what I thought was my next perfect car. I sent in all the requested paperwork and went with Root and my insurance company. The car came on a Tuesday evening. The agent that was dropping it off told me I could do a five minute test drive and only 5 minutes because I had 7 days to test drive the car. I seen little imperfection that wasn't stated but I wasn't worried because it was a used car. I gave them my trade in and thought the is the begin of a new relationship with my new car. I really didn't get to drive until my next day off on a Saturday. I drove maybe 5 minutes down the road and all these warning lights started coming on. The main light that scared me was the check engine and a message saying the car had a drivetrain issue.  From what I was told and read that the drivetrain had to deal with he transmission. When I got home I went in the glovebox to get the owner manual and I found paperwork that the check engine light was on two months ago (but it didn't say what for) I did not want this car anymore but I didn't want my car back. I didn't think help with this was unreasonable. The experience went from bad to worse in a matter of days. They didn't have another car (same make and model) in my price range. They wanted me to pay more and have a bigger down payment or find a different car. I could go on for days about this situation but to sum it up. I got my car back with all the gas gone, my tags (registration ) was taken off my car which I have to replace, the tires made a funny noise (which it didn't before) and dried chunk of gum was running down the back side of my car.  Again it so much more I could say but the most important thing to say is buyer beware!!!!!",no response,No response

2530,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,2,08/11/2021,"I started looking at Carvana about a month ago. I was uneasy about purchasing something I would not see or touch until after I had committed to owning said purchase. After days and weeks of research, I found the car I had been looking for. It had a little more miles than I would have preferred, but everything else was what I wanted. So I thought, well with a 7 day guarantee, why not! This is where things miserably wrong and yet amazingly well depending on where you were in the process.The moment I said yes was a mess - I had in my hot little hands the start of my trade in. I had given them general info about my trade in, but nothing specific when I started looking a month prior. Now that I had said yes to the car, I need to get a final offer, which was simple, just upload pictures of the milage, title, and my driver's license. Life was good and I was offered about what I thought I would get for a trade..... So, on to applying my trade to my purchase. This is where things went wrong. For 2 days I sat in the cycle loop of their tool trying to apply my trade in. Nothing worked so I attempted support. My support rep didn't understand how to spell car yet alone how to troubleshoot. So disconnect and get a new guy. This person seemed ok and new what they were doing. We had a conversation they were kind, and then all of a sudden without warning, they were gone. Come to find out it was the end of their day, so without warning they just went away..... So called the support / customer support line. Talked to a nice lady who said, yes sometimes there's an issue with our software and this happens. Let me put in a ticket to get it resolved. I'll also extend the car's purchase for 24 hours so we can get this resolved....... Next day, after 3 people I finally got someone of all things on FB messenger. Apparently because I stated the trade in process a month ago and didn't finish, my trade had sudo expired. They fixed it, and away we went.... The rest of the buying experience was easy peasy and flying. We were done in 10 minutes and received a call a bit later asking for one more document. But after that we were approved! Wahoo, my new Tesla would be here in a few days..... Oh man the excitement! Fast forward to delivery day. My delivery driver, was the brightest star of this entire mess! Oh man was he amazing. He deserves a gold star, a bucket of candy, and someone to do something amazing for him, he really made what was a so-so experience better, and he would have gotten 100 stars in a review on his own.So he texted me specific instructions before his arrival. Then shortly before he was to arrive, he called to say, the car was really low on battery life. He gave me my options (deliver, wait and let him charge for a bit, or reschedule my delivery). I chose to have him bring the car, after all, I can plug it in as easy as he can.He showed up, was kind professional, he had read my file and knew the purchase was a mess, so he brought me a little peace offering, he walked my car and found a little extra's that were not disclosed so HE started the paperwork to make them right, he did everything plus some that should've been done! He really provided a truly amazing experience.Also, he didn't feel the car was detailed to a good enough standard, so he applied a credit to my account so I could have it properly cleaned. What account or how that works, I don't know that calling customer support is really would do again. And then..... Well the charger was missing. Not his fault, he got on the phone to resolve the situation. And we agreed that I would go to their location to get a charger. No harm no foul. Drove about 30 minutes away and picked up the charger. The only issue I have was I was told the car had a Tesla charger and I was offered an off brand with a Tesla add on to fit my car. It is what it is.Here I am the day after the delivery. I love the car and as soon as it has full power I will be excited to drive it. After talking with Tesla it takes several days and maybe a week for the car to be switched to the new owner. Until then you cannot use their charging stations so your only option is at home. Normally this would not be an issue, and if the car had not had such a low battery then it really wouldn't have been an issue. So in the future, and since you have a TON of Teslas, I'd suggest ensuring they are fully charged and all cords are in the vehicle when delivered. Tesla's customer service, or lack there of does not help the situation. Also, if Carvana would've taken over the Tesla from the previous owner, they could've transferred the car right to me, and I'd be on my way in 10 minutes but because they did not, I cannot use the features of the Tesla including charging for a week or so.Knowing what I know, would I us Carvana again? I don't know. The misses were pretty big, but the delivery driver made all the difference! If I knew I'd have that same delivery experience, maybe. If I had an awful delivery experience they would have taken the car back.I'll be excited when I can actually enjoy my car. Hopefully soon.",no response,No response

Once they were adamant about us paying for the tow, I told them to come get their car and where it was sitting in Alabama. We couldnt even get a rental car because they wont do one way trips. We had to purchase airfare to return home. They finally said they would come get the car the next day and they showed up in Indiana.  I called them one last time and informed them their car would be in Alabama at the address I gave them multiple times, it would be unlocked with the key in it, and we would not be there.  They showed up a few days later and tried to put the car in gear and realized what I told them was correct.  They had to drag the car onto the flatbed.

Figure if Im wronged or dont like it, just wont buy it again however, the service was so incredibly bad that it cost me thousands of dollars. I was set to pickup my new car, received about 3 texts a day from carvana about the pickup of my car but then received a text the night before pickup that my car wouldnt be ready (after they told me it was) and Ill need to reschedule. Well, I had a trip booked down south that required a vehicle, and without it, I either had to eat thousands of dollars in tickets and hotel stays or spend about a couple thousand on renting a vehicle. After spending an entire day trying to get an answer from carvana, I was finally told it was due to the title not being with the vehicle which is required at time of purchase. I pleaded with them to overnight the title (which they finally did) but it still didnt matter because they werent willing to move anything around or squeeze me in for pickup. So the car and the title were sitting at the hub while youre being spammed via text and email about how quick the purchase will be but theyre not willing to give you 15mins to pickup the car. Needless to say, I had to spend a couple thousand on a rental while their customer service offered me $175.00 check after purchase for my troubles. What a slap in the face, doesnt even cover a car payment or a single night hotel stay or an hour with the rental car an absolute joke. They could have offered first two payments on them, a reduction one percentage points, h*** 15 personal minutes to come grab the car but nope, they provided absolutely no customer service.

The company pushes its 7 day guarantee, which is the only thing that they have going for them.

We called Carvana and they immediately offered to ""swap out the car for another one"" instead of trying to help us solve the issue. The company that handles claims on the back-end is called SilverRock and they're not only extremely rude, they're ultimately useless. They will promise you that something will be approved for repair (like a leak in the engine!) and then string you along with more requests (pictures, 2nd opinions, etc) which of course is to help Carvana run out the 7 day return policy....thus sticking you with the car. When we called and requested that they pick up the vehicle and give us a full refund (including the fee they charge for delivery) that's when Carvana's niceness ended. The customer support person's tone changed and tried to delay our request by ""24 hours"" to ""see if we can refund the delivery fee"" which of course they can.Moral of the story, Carvana deals in scale. Their approach to customer support is to offer none of it, because their model is the bet that their ""convenience"" will at least get you to try a second vehicle before you cut ties with them.

The process seemed super easy, and there was always new inventory, providing plenty of options. Once I selected the car, I was given a pickup date, which today is a little over a month ago. The past month has consisted of a pattern of a text saying how excited they are that my appointment for pickup for tomorrow, shortly followed by a notice that pickup has been delayed, giving a new date anywhere from 1 day to 2 weeks in the future. After reaching out, I discovered that the problems lies with the title of the vehicle, which raises questions as to why the car was allowed to be sold with such an enormous red flag.

Their first issue was the title (which I understand) so went and had that switched from the estate of (even though I was the estate) to my name. Next there was an issue of a name change (which I submitted and wrote in the notes explaining of a recent divorce). Wasnt good enough for them. Resubmitted same info they come back with not all four corners of the back of the title are showing (they were), then it was an issue of they wanted the back of the title in a colored picture (hello what I took a picture of is exactly what the title is, its white and grey so Not sure how I can correct that without falsifying a document), then they have an issue with the mileage and want me to correct it with carfax, of course the mileage is more now, the car did stay with me for an entire week while attempting to correct errors you said were there that werent and the new title you wanted in my name specifically had more mileage listed because I just got the title which came after getting the offer.

It makes sense since their last email to me was trying to tell me I had to submit for a new offer after uploading a colored copy of the title which mind you has been uploaded And was an original picture Of said title.

I started my whole process with Carvana 06/06/21 chose my vehicle 06/09/21 and it was processed 06/10. It all was simple and smooth and it seemed too good to be true. This is where it all went downhill. Everything wrong with Carvana is all in the details. Their app and website and reviews they show all everything in bold while searching for your car gives you estimates of how early you can receive your car. It always shows as early within a week give or take a few days. From all the reviews Ive read and from my own personal experience it is never that amount of time. This is what I mean by its all in the details, the fine print you electronically sign giving you the real information that they can reschedule dates and it may take even longer because of transports. Setting an expectation for your customers especially one where theres excitement for wanting their new car they just purchased is a big deal! Carvana  has been known to cancel the day before your scheduled delivery. Letting the customer be filled with anticipation and excitement only to kill it by letting you know only 1 day before. It is now 08/01/21, mins you again I started and processed my order 06/10/21, and I still do not have my car. My down payment was taken, my credit was hit and Im left heartbroken and faced with no choice but to wait. I would take dealing with a car dealership and car sales reps any day then have to be put through this. Carvana has only given me countless apologies explaining this was in their fine print that delays happen without attempting to try to make it better. Dealing with automated responses via text not a real live person messaging you then when that goes wrong only then will a live person start messaging you. I was basically told it was up to me to try to reschedule for an earlier date and that even with doing that it would start the whole process again I would have to sign the paperwork electronically again which could potentially leave me to an even further date out. There were no clear answers for anything in this whole process just stating policies and apologies.

Every Carvana representative I speak to on a weekly basis assuring me everything is in and will be expedited. When I ask if my paperwork is with Carvana, third party reviewer, or my state DMV, the response is the review is in process and they are working with the **** I've asked to speak with supervisors on four occasions and have yet to get a response by email or phone. I had to acquire a VIN verification form which Carvana had mistakes on their version while they had the vehicle. I have wasted 240 hours of my own time explaining, verifying, and acquiring documents (which dealers normally handle) to complete a simple vehicle purchase. In closing, the purchase is not complete three months after receiving the vehicle. I will NEVER purchase another vehicle from Carvana!",no response,No response
2599,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,1,08/01/2021,"TLDR: Two weeks of delays, stressful arbitrary deadlines, website glitches, hours on the phone with under-informed assistants -- only to cancel the whole purchase because of a dangerous recall that had been in effect for a week, but Carvana never told us about.  The process was slow, opaque, and we could've burned our building down if I hadn't accidentally found out about the recall.So here was our experience with Carvana, using ""Day #"" for clarity.Day 0: Started an order for a car we loved.  The car is ""held"" for us for 30 minutes - not long enough to gather all the loan details we need to actually place the order.  The time elapsed after I had input tons of information, and the car was then open to the public again... I didn't want to lose my progress, but apparently letting the time run out really confused the system because my account kept crashing, giving me access to the in-progress order one minute and then deleting it the next.  After some laborious texting with an assistant, I got this fixed and a 24-hr hold put on so we could finish our order.Also, Carvana doesn't let you add a co-titleholder to the order; you can only apply as a single person.  Strange!Day 1: Placed the order: says we'll get the car on Thursday (currently Saturday; Th would be Day 5) - great!  Except -- the system has automatically generated deadlines of today (Saturday) and tomorrow (Sunday noon) for verifying all our loan paperwork (which we can't finish yet because it's a weekend) and verifying that my bank account has the entire down payment in it (transfer was in progress but not finished because it's a weekend - and, they're not actually withdrawing the money until the delivery anyway).  Called an assistant and found out that because we couldn't meet these deadlines, we'd need to push the delivery back to the following weekend (think: Day 7), and the assistant would update those deadlines for us.  Annoyed about this, but whatever, I guess it's because we started the process on a weekend.Day 2: Checked the account.  The deadlines have reverted back to the original ones and are telling us certain info is overdue.  I.e., the assistant didn't actually update them correctly.  Called again, waited a while, and got the deadlines fixed.Day 3: Notification from Carvana that they're really sorry, but the car won't be ready for delivery on Day 7.  It's a transportation issue on their end. I reschedule for Day 10 (a Tuesday) and that seems to work.Day 3, later: Went onto my account again and saw that our delivery had been changed to Day 20 (!!), without anyone asking or notifying me.  I went to change it back to Day 10, thinking surely 10 days from our order is enough lead time to get us the car - didn't work this time.  Earliest it would let me schedule is for Day 14 -- still transportation issues on their end.Day 5: called Carvana to ask for monetary compensation for their delay, and they offered $25/day -- not quite enough to cover the rental car we would need to commute to work, but I accept.  Generally feeling annoyed about the whole process so far and wanting to get it over with.  Every assistant over the phone was different, and they were usually very helpful, but clearly didn't know everything and often things got lost in communication from one assistant to another.Day 12: Carvana assured me that even though my fiancee's name wasn't on any of the title paperwork, ""as long as both your names are on the lease, you're fine"" which other experts have since told me is really sketchy.Day 13: I call to just make sure everything is good to go for delivery on Day 14.  While on the phone, I happen to stumble across a pop-up on the car's Carvana listing page for a Stop-Sale Recall on the car for dangerous battery fires (!!!).  The assistant I was talking to had no idea, and this appeared nowhere on our order or account.  Turns out, the recall had been in effect for a week and CARVANA DIDN'T NOTIFY ** OF THE RECALL -- if I hadn't notified *them*, we would've accepted a car (a week late) that was liable to catch fire in our garage and burn our apartment building down.  They assured me they'd cancel the order, submit my complaint, and get back to me ""ASAP"" about a discount on a different car.Day 14: I get a text saying ""Today's the day!"" for my delivery. The previous assistant never canceled the **** order, and the system won't let me do it online.  I call again, talk to a different assistant who also doesn't know any of the backstory, and get the whole thing canceled once and for all.The next day, we went to a local dealership, bought a car, and picked it up the following day.  All while talking to a salesperson who knew every step of the process.  Still no word from Carvana about a discount.",no response,No response

The first person,  my friend told me that she loved Carvana, the whole process, she had an issue with her car after a month,  but Carvana repaired the problem immediately at no cost to her,  another person who is not a friend but works at Aamco, told me the same words, he said he loved Carvana cause the process is so easy,  he had no problems with his car.  This is what made me go with Carvana, cause after getting 2 excellent comments about them, I thought ok, this is where I'm getting my car from. To be honest, I was a little ***** about buying a car online,  I have never done it this way before,  I didn't know what to expect,  I didn't know if I was really going to like the car or not,  I bought a 2015 ***** CRV, but I do have to say,  I love my car, it is so comfortable,  and drives so smooth.  Even though Carvana does a 150 point inspection, I still had my own personal mechanic check it out, he was impressed with the condition of my car,  he said everything was nice and tight underneath,  nothing loose,  no signs of any kind of leaks, only ****** miles, he said I got a great car,  which made me real happy.  He also told me I couldn't go wrong with a *****, cause *****'s just like Toyotas last a very long time. Anyway, I absolutely love Carvana, they made everything smooth and easy for me,  even going over all the paperwork over the phone,  to make sure I did everything right.

However, over the course of the trial week I noticed some problems with the car that were not listed on the website. There were a lot more scratches than what was pictured, the breaks screech horribly and the pads need to be replaced ASAP, theres no button to fold one of the seats in the back down, theres no gas cap, and theres no gas lever cover (just a tiny metal lever that my boyfriend thankfully was there to point out to me when I needed gas the first time). Youd think Carvana would lower the price to reflect these things, its a pretty expensive car, but no. Youd think there would be any kind of sorry to inconvenience you, but there wasnt. Instead I have been told to take my car to a mechanic and to get a quote through silver rock. I know that none of theses issues are covered by this company because they are not mechanical.

2610,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,2,07/30/2021,"While I thought I was getting a good deal on a very nice looking, low mileage car, I found out differently. They sold me a car that had been in a minor (or maybe bigger) accident that was ""repaired"". They did a good job of detailing the car to hide the some of the flaws that I did not notice right away. This car only had 8k miles on it, so lets start there. As of right now I'm only at 16k and I have had it over a year. For the past year the bad body paint job to cover the repairs has become more and more noticeable. I bought in the middle of winter so I really didn't get out and wax my car by hand for a few months. After doing so though, I saw overspray on the black plastic body molds. Now this car only had 8k miles on it, and they reported no accident and only minor scratches in 2 places which it did have. No where did they say the whole back bumper and driver side rear door had been completely repainted. A year later and its really noticeable as the back door is a different shade of blue than the rest of the side. There is a paint drip that dried that way and the backup sensors have been painted over and the paint on those is starting to flake off.     That is the cosmetic side of it. When I first got the car, about a week or two AFTER the return period I started driving it a bit more. Mind you, my work is only 3 miles away and its residential, not really getting up to speed at all. Once I started driving it out on the highways I noticed it felt like it was pulling a little. I took it into my local alignment shop and the first thing the guy says to me after looking at it was ""Has this thing been in an accident"". That statement floored me as I didn't even notice the outside flaws yet. He said the tow and camber were off in such a weird  way something had to have happened to it. I called carvana and they basically said we can fix it but it ""WAS NOT"" in any accidents, and there is a deductible on the work since it was over a certain period of time. Now, I know people can get into an accident, have a friends body shop fix it, and its never reported anywhere. Carvana brags about how in depth they go for their inspections, but how did they not notice any of this? This leads me to believe they bought this car from a dealership that new it was damaged, very cheaply fixed the outside and sent it on its way due to the low mileage.      For a company that brags how well they inspect these cars they obviously do not. For them to tell a customer that something was not in an accident, that clearly was if a ""real"" shop looks at it tells me this company lies. I ended up paying for the alignment issue as I would have had to pay a deductible that amounted to basically the full price. I even brought up to them later on after finding the paint issues that this was repaired and repainted, and they were very rude to me and told me it was not. If I end up having serious issues with the paint job within 2 years or so of buying this I will lawyer up and take them to court. The pictures of the car online, now that I know what I'm looking for, even show what I'm talking about. So you can clearly see it was that way before I bought it and they hid it.     So buyer beware if you buy from them. The experience was smooth, they just sell things either without truly checking them, or they do a bad job fixing it themselves and cover it up. Just know if they show you 3 ""light scratches"" on the car, there is much more hidden. This car was obviously in a wreck, the person traded it in on a new one (why else are you getting rid of it at 8k miles). Carfax shows its a private owner, and that it was sold/traded in to a dealership, not auctioned off like a repo.",no response,No response

If you are reading this, PLEASE don't buy into their ""feel good"" commercials or you will more than likely end up where we are:  paying thousands to get a car repaired or thousands to save a young girls credit, paying for a car that isn't drivable.",no response,No response

Around 11pm on that same Friday, my check engine light turned on. The next day I had my husband check the fluids to see if the fluids were low. The fluids were fine. So I took my vehicle to a silver rock repair facility on Saturday July 24, 2021 and I was told that I was sold a faulty vehicle and that my vehicle needs an entirely brand new ENGINE! The mechanics told me that it looks like the carvana dealership did a ""temporary fix"" by replacing the spark plugs so that the check engine light wouldn't come on, because they knew this vehicle needed a new engine. My husband and I got the premier coverage, and silver rock was being difficult saying no that's not to problem you need to try replacing the coils. Well they replaced the coils and my vehicle is still messed up. Long story short I was told that I need to take my vehicle to a **** dealership to have my engine replaced. I haven't even had this vehicle for 24 hours when I found out it needed a brand new engine. I called and complained to carvana AND silverrock MULTIPLE times and they finally approved the claim to get my engine replaced. My appointment with **** isn't until the 30th. I asked carvana if we decide to get a different vehicle, will they at least waive the delivery fee and they told us no. The only thing that they could do is extend my 7 day warranty 2 more days and send me a check for $150 that will take over a month to send out. Before we even signed off on the vehicle I asked if I would be able to take the vehicle to be repaired and make payments without any trouble because my husband is going to be deployed next month. I was told yes. When I called carvana when I took it to a silverrock repair facility they told me ""we can't speak to you we have to speak to your husband"" This is the worst car buying experience I have ever had in my entire life. The customer support is horrible and you will get nowhere. Silverrock customer support is terrible and everyone gave ME attitude when I was sold a faulty vehicle that needs a new engine not even 24 hours of having the vehicle.

2650,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,2,07/24/2021,"When I went to purchase my vehicle, there was a technical issue on their side. I spoke with several reps, was hung up on/disconnected a few times. Few people genuinely did their job and looked into things. I was already approved by the lender, it was a matter of sighing paperwork. Like any company trying to do business well, I was told ""everything would be okay and [my] business would kept"". When they finally got technical issues resolved, we were waiting on the lender. Lender sent over the necessary information. I spoke with three reps that day, all telling me that information was missing. The last person, I got to look into the paperwork, ""oh! It's been there!"". Moved on from that, and waiting on the final paperwork from the lender. First day, it was a lender issue, which was resolved on the lender side early on the second day. I spoke with about six different people at Carvana over the three days. I was told by two that i didn't need to call back because I would get an alert from the company to notify me about the process moving forward. That did not happen. I spoke with the fifth person, who told me not to call back because I'd be contacted. I called the lender, because both companies said it'd take 48hrs, and it was over 100hrs at this point. Lender said, ""paperwork was sent two days ago"". Call back Caravana and got the ""oh! Here it is!"" again; what was most irritating about this was that it was like five to ten minutes between the first and second call. I spoke with about 20 different representatives by phone, was disconnected from two calls, had two separate text communications from representatives who did not have access to information or were not paying attention to information. The last call, they told me ""someone is buying your vehicle"", by my vehicle it was the one I was purchasing, ""let's look at other vehicles in case the other purchaser doesn't want to give it up"". I had already signed agreements, Carvana and the lender signed them too, that vehicle should not be being purchased by anyone. That had actually happened two or three times prior, during all the issues going on. The last time, after everything I had gone through, after everything Carvana had already put me through...concise and polite words, I have none. So, about one business well later, everything is good; vehicle is going to be sent to me, no other paperwork needed, so forth. Delivery driver calls me and asked me if I could meet him somewhere where the large truck could be unloaded. Back and forth texts. Basically, this delivery company did not do their homework about where they were delivering to and were requesting that I come up with a solution. A nice, enthusiastic, considerate woman delivered my vehicle. We signed off on paperwork, and I should be done with Carvana. I got a flat within a week; sensors worked great. I was happy, sans there being no **** (vehicle did not come with spare, which is common for the vehicle I got, but never found if the **** not coming with it was typical). At this point I also realized that the vehicle I was sold came with two sets of tires. No big deal. The front end tires were less than 2/32 tread, though, which is ""illegal"" in my state, and obviously unsafe, and an asinine, careless, unsafe, selfish move by either company. The flat tire got me thinking about the alarm system. The dealer the vehicle was prepared at left paperwork showing they removed the after-market car alarm, but no mention of the one the vehicle came with. So I contacted Carvana to find out about the company that took out the after-market alarm, to ask them about the market alarm. They had someone text me. That person told me to hold on so they could get the information. I ended up responding over twelve hours later, during a work break, because I had gotten no response, no information. I let Carvana know about the tires and the lack of support and organization, and got no response. I purchased the vehicle really May. I still haven't received the title or other paperwork. I contacted Carvana and got no direct response from the company, but later received a notice that ""everything went through!"" like I'm supposed to be impressed or excited; it's the company's job, I paid for the service, and you're late. It was fun to look through the vehicles, but it was not worth it in the end. I am extremely busy and figured this would be great to help me in purchasing a vehicle, less hassle, and I'd heard so many good things about the company from others. I overpaid for services and product that I did not get. I'm happy with my vehicle at this time, because I needed a new vehicle for my family. I would never purchase from Carvana again, because while I have an immense amount of tolerance, good quality in timeliness, organization, support, services, and good quality of product matter more to me and should not be a compromise. A buck over safety should not be a compromise. I would not recommend purchasing from Carvana based on my experience. I am surprised they are still in business.

This looks great.  Let's give it a shot.""  Bought and traded in a car.  The vehicle was supposed to arrive in 7 days.  The day before arrival, we got a phone call that there was a ""transportation issue"" and it wouldn't be coming.  It was scheduled for a week later.  Two days before that arrival date, now it's, ""There's a problem with the car and we need to fix it before we can deliver it.""  After hours of phone calls, we find out it's a parking sensor that's on backorder and they're waiting on it plus they need to do ""some body work to fix scratches on the car.""

And somehow no one noticed at Carvana, the company that told us (and you in their commercials) all of their cars go through rigorous inspections.  The driver's door popped when you opened and closed it like the hinge was falling off.  The body shop also sprayed the front bumper and hood.  They didn't tape the undercarriage off so they over sprayed all over the plastic pieces under the car.  And worse yet, the paint was already peeling off the bumper like they didn't prep it before they painted so it wasn't sticking to the body of the car.  The hood was rippled because they sprayed over (2) 4"" long rust spots.  All I could do was shake my head.  We pointed all this out to the representative who was very apologetic and said he thought it would be covered under the warranty.  So against our better judgment we accepted the car.  He said someone would contact us within 48 hours to schedule the repairs.  Two days later, no one has called.  We call the insurance company they go through.  They said Carvana never submitted anything for our car.  So now we have to submit it which we do.  The next day, the key no longer works on the car.  It's a keyless entry and ignition so anytime we have to get in the car, we have to set the alarm off, open the door, and quickly press the fob against the ignition and start it to get the alarm to stop going off.  LITERALLY, every time we want to get in the car.  We submit a claim for that issue to the insurance.  Go to the gas station, the fuel door won't open.  I had to pry it open with a credit card.  Submit that issue to insurance.  More hours wasted on the phone with Carvana.  We had a trip planned.  They say go on the trip and we'll extend your 7 days test period a couple days while insurance works everything out.  We do, again, setting the alarm off every time we want to use our car.  A week has passed and the insurance company has not approved any of the work to be done except for fixing the door hinge.  While we were driving on our trip, I realized the car was shaking a lot under moderate to heavy braking (meaning the brake rotors are bad).  Didn't even bother with insurance this time.  Called Carvana and said come pick this piece of junk up.  They came the first scheduled time on the return (which was nice) and delivered my trade in car back to us on a rollback.  Because they needed approved to accept their car back (because of the extra test drive days and miles) we talked to the delivery driver for a bit.  He was actually at our house for 2 hours.  He said this happens all the time because of issues that aren't reported during the purchase.  So what I'm hearing is basically, they don't inspect the cars at all and just hope that there's nothing wrong with them.  Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't.  How can that possibly be your business model?  So on to my trade in.  He's pulls the car off the rollback.  It looks like it's been driven through the dessert.  The wheels are light tan and the sides are caked in dust.  I'm assuming what happened is it was parked in a dirt lot and when other cars drive by, it kicks up dust on the other cars.  Regardless of what happened, it's completely unacceptable.  We complained.  The rep said they would give us a $100 credit to go get it cleaned.  Just send us a copy of the receipt and we'll send you a check.  We submitted it 3 weeks ago and still no refund.  I have to assume we're not getting that money back.  Lastly, the car was delivered back without the title (we own the car free and clear).  The delivery driver said no one told him it needed to be sent with the title.  **************** said, ""Oh, it already got sent to headquarters so they'll send it back to you.""  I got it back 2 weeks later just to find out it was void because they had already wrote on it.  So now I need to go to DMV and apply for a new copy of the title which will cost me more money.  This was absolutely the worst experience we could have had.  I really don't know what worse could have happened.  I will NEVER EVER recommend Carvana to anyway and I make it a point when people bring Carvana up to tell them our nightmare of a story so they know what they're getting themselves into.  Please do yourself a favor and avoid this company at all costs.",no response,No response
2668,Carvana LLC,1126-1000037076,8003334554,5,07/22/2021,This was the best car buying experience I have ever had. Having been in the car business for years I figured I would just contact my friends still working in the business and get my car. Time was short and I tried Carvana. I can't see buying another car any other way. They lived up to the promises and I am very pleased! The car was immaculate and exceeded my expectations as far as condition.,no response,No response
